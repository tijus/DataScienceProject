Ã¢ÂÂYou go into class and see empty desks. ItÃ¢ÂÂs different for everyone now.Ã¢ÂÂ,Near the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, 150 to 200 people, most of them Americans, held signs saying Ã¢ÂÂbullets arenÃ¢ÂÂt school suppliesÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂWaffeln statt WaffenÃ¢ÂÂ (Waffles Instead of Weapons).,Advertisement,Dylan von Felbert, 16, an 11th grader at the John F.

In a New Biography of the Bouvier Women, Jealousies Rule Advertisement,None,None,None,Nancy herself was often the Lee figure of the Mitford household: a bright and stylish woman who would have been the star of almost any family on earth. She was constantly confronted by the figure of her sister Diana, a political extremist who possessed an otherworldly power of commanding idolatry. All her life, Nancy was jealous of Diana, partly for her beauty but more for the indomitable and rare self-control that enabled Diana to remain sphinx-like, serene and supremely herself no matter what befell her.,Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had that same defining quality. J. Randy Taraborrelli presents a woman of passion, both sexual and emotional, whose facade somehow always remains in place. It is strange, in an age of female sound and fury, this enduring fixation on a near-silent woman who put forth the decorous veneer of an aristocratic hostess. But the magic of JackieÃ¢ÂÂs aura is imperishable to this day, which explains why Taraborrelli has written a third book with this one womanÃ¢ÂÂs mystery at its heart (following Ã¢ÂÂJackie, Ethel, JoanÃ¢ÂÂ and its sequel, Ã¢ÂÂAfter CamelotÃ¢ÂÂ).,Advertisement,Jackie existed (to her own occasional dismay) very much in the eye of the beholder, ever an object of fascination, even worship. Those close to her, however Ã¢ÂÂ particularly Lee Ã¢ÂÂ could find her intolerably frustrating, just as Diana was to Nancy. In TaraborrelliÃ¢ÂÂs account, one gets a sense of LeeÃ¢ÂÂs life as a series of reactions against her sister, a hectic parade of attention-seeking antics: three marriages (the second to Prince Stanislaw Ã¢ÂÂStasÃ¢ÂÂ Radziwill); and brief brushes against the worlds of fashion, acting, writing. Then there were the high-profile affairs, the most infamous being the one with the Greek millionaire magnate Aristotle Onassis, who from the early 1960s had set his eye on the greater prize, LeeÃ¢ÂÂs American royal-sister. Of course, Jackie herself engaged in many of the same behaviors, but to entirely different effect.,Advertisement,None,Yet the competition had been ongoing from the first. In 1941, the 12-year-old Jackie was scheduled to play a piano piece for her school assembly. Despite her best efforts, her performance was rather wretched, only to be followed by an immaculate rendition by the 9-year-old Lee, who had been practicing in secret in order to achieve just such a triumph.,Taraborrelli is highly effective at describing this sisterly dynamic Ã¢ÂÂ the bond that tensed at the least provocation; the never-fully-sincere exchanges of Ã¢ÂÂI love youÃ¢ÂÂ; even, at the height of some ghastly adult trauma, uneasy relapses into games of Ã¢ÂÂYouÃ¢ÂÂre it.Ã¢ÂÂ The material, most of which will inevitably be familiar to many readers, is newly enhanced by telling, gossipy details from a satisfying bundle of interviews. The sistersÃ¢ÂÂ half brother, Jamie Auchincloss, who became persona non grata after he spoke to the author Kitty Kelley about Jackie circa 1977, provides a running commentary that portrays a society whose tastefully presented aim is to keep its chalice of wealth and privilege filled to the brim. Ã¢ÂÂMoney is power,Ã¢ÂÂ as Jackie once said to Jack Warnecke, the lover she took after KennedyÃ¢ÂÂs death Ã¢ÂÂ the architect who designed the gravesite memorial at Arlington, and whom she later left for the unassailably rich Onassis.,For all the sistersÃ¢ÂÂ dramatics, the true star of this particular show is decidedly neither the directionless Lee nor the determined Jackie. It is, in fact, the third figure in the book: Janet Bouvier Auchincloss, their diet-pill-popping Ã¢ÂÂMummy,Ã¢ÂÂ hostess of the Ã¢ÂÂmother-daughter teasÃ¢ÂÂ to which she was still inviting her girls as they approached 40. Descended from Irish Catholics, just like the Kennedys, whom she regarded with a hauteur only leavened with a respect for their money, Janet claimed kinship with the English upper class broadly, and even a specific relation to the lineage of Robert E. Lee.,None,Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.,Invalid email address. Please re-enter.,You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.,View all New York Times newsletters.,None,In JamieÃ¢ÂÂs recollection, JackieÃ¢ÂÂs response to this exhortation was: Ã¢ÂÂI guess it takes a mother to say Ã¢ÂÂsnap out of it,Ã¢ÂÂ doesnÃ¢ÂÂt it?Ã¢ÂÂ The resulting impression of Jackie as resentful and respectful in equal measure, these twin emotions running far too deep within her for expression, is probably accurate. To be sure, certain cruelties were perpetrated upon Janet by her precious Ã¢ÂÂJacquelineÃ¢ÂÂ: Though she could have used the fortune she inherited from Onassis to preserve the familyÃ¢ÂÂs ownership of Hammersmith Farm, the glorious Auchincloss estate at Newport, Jackie instead allowed it to be sold. Was this revenge for JanetÃ¢ÂÂs harsh mothering? Surely. Yet it was Janet who had infused her daughters with the ineffable standards that carried them both through life, and helped to create JackieÃ¢ÂÂs matchless iconography.,None,Janet wanted her girls to marry rich men who would also treat them as ladies, as her own beloved Jack had failed to do. She boldly confronted Onassis over his lack of commitment to Lee, and advocated divorce when Kennedy remained on a Mediterranean cruise after learning that Jackie had lost their first baby, Arabella. By todayÃ¢ÂÂs reckoning, Janet was a monster of a mother; but Taraborrelli paints her with a kind of superb pathos, a profound belief in appearances that no longer holds today yet underpins our ongoing fascination with this tale. These women dealt in surfaces, but that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean they lacked depth. They made no achievements by any modern standard, but this deliciously readable book is not in the business of judging: It knows its value better than that.,Laura Thompson is the author, most recently, of Ã¢ÂÂThe Six: The Lives of the Mitford Sisters.Ã¢ÂÂ Her next book, Ã¢ÂÂAgatha Christie: A Mysterious Life,Ã¢ÂÂ will be published in March.,None,None,None,We earn an affiliate commission with each book purchase, which helps support our journalism at The New York Times.,Go to Home Page ÃÂ»,
Hotel Belleclaire: A Dowager on the Rise Advertisement,None,None,None,My life became entwined with the Hotel Belleclaire on the Upper West Side 35 years ago, and together we have evolved.,While living here, I have changed careers, come out of the closet, managed a long recuperation from brain surgery, started meditating, and watched a dear friend die of AIDS in my apartmentÃ¢ÂÂs front bedroom. And the building has continued its own endless metamorphosis, shifting from stately residential hotel where Maxim Gorky, Mark Twain and Babe Ruth once stayed, to seedy single-room-occupancy flop joint, to what it is today, a boutique hotel undergoing yet another face-lift.,When I first came East from California in 1981, I moved to Park Slope, Brooklyn. But architecturally I took in all five boroughs, which provided a cornucopia of treats for my hungry eyes.,In 1982, I made my first trek to the Ã¢ÂÂwild wild WestÃ¢ÂÂ of Manhattan Ã¢ÂÂ the Upper West Side. The upswing anticipated for the neighborhood with the creation of Lincoln Center in the mid-1960s had been slower than anticipated. Still, during those seemingly stagnant years, new consideration was given to many of the forgotten architectural treasures the area had to offer, in part thanks to the establishment of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1965.,Advertisement,Despite all of that, as late as the early 1980s, the Upper West Side still looked tired.,None,The Belleclaire, built in 1903, was a very early example of Emery RothÃ¢ÂÂs work and scarcely anticipated his later, more celebrated buildings, including the two towers of the Eldorado on Central Park West.,Ã¢ÂÂSomeday, IÃ¢ÂÂm going to live in that building,Ã¢ÂÂ I vowed to my disbelieving friend at that 1982 luncheon.,Six months later, I miraculously acquired a lease for a two-bedroom apartment here. Even though the Belleclaire was a registered single room occupancy, or S.R.O., hotel, it had several larger apartments available for lease. My first home here was a high-ceilinged, east-facing space Ã¢ÂÂ an oddly laid out mash up of five hotel rooms.,Back in those S.R.O. days, I remember the flickering fluorescents down long, spooky halls; a multitude of drug dealers; the occasional scream from behind thick doors; and a muscular, aggressive pimp and two of his women hanging out in the lobby. I loved it all.,Advertisement,None,Much here began to change in the 1990s, after the hotel received landmark status. Sure of the buildingÃ¢ÂÂs future, the owners kick-started its journey from S.R.O. to stylish boutique hotel. Triumph Hotels Ã¢ÂÂ the owner of the Belleclaire since 1999 Ã¢ÂÂ has acquired six other historic buildings in the city, including the landmark Evelyn hotel down in NoMad and the stately Art Deco Hotel Edison in the theater district, the largest of the chain.,The BelleclaireÃ¢ÂÂs entrance was a low-ceilinged, narrow cubicle in my early days here, its walls painted a high-gloss brown. The area behind the front desk was an industrial yellow and the floor was a drab linoleum and was later covered with faux wood planks.,But the lobby has since been recreated with an eye toward the hotelÃ¢ÂÂs elegant past. It is now light-filled and wood paneled, with subtle dark stone insets in the walls near the elevators. After much work, the simple original mosaic Ã¢ÂÂ worthy of a prosperous Pompeian merchantÃ¢ÂÂs home Ã¢ÂÂ has been unearthed. Hiding beyond a black dropped ceiling and lost to everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs memory was a vast expanse of glass which once covered the hotelÃ¢ÂÂs fashionable Palm Court and has now been restored to its full glory.,Recently, Art Nouveau mahogany and bent wood windows on the ground floor have been recreated to match the originals. The windowsÃ¢ÂÂ shapes are reminiscent of the beautifully maintained Hector Guimard Art Nouveau entrances to the Paris Metro, evidence that keen respect and appreciation make possible the enjoyment of our architectural heritage for generations.,Hotel Belleclaire is undergoing a partial exterior restoration, an undertaking which will help bring back much of its original grandeur. RothÃ¢ÂÂs finely carved exterior limestone details give the Belleclaire an exciting theatricality, one sorely missing in many of the newer, utilitarian steel and glass high-rises jack-rabbiting skyward all around Manhattan.,Robert Holmes, the manager of the Belleclaire, is keen on the work going on. Ã¢ÂÂI love watching these changes happen,Ã¢ÂÂ he said, as we stood together out on Broadway recently, observing blocks of limestone facing being off-loaded from a truck. Ã¢ÂÂThe limestone is from a quarry in Indiana, pulled up from a site close to the one Roth used for the original limestone decorations,Ã¢ÂÂ he said.,The New York Tribune in 1905 recommended the Belleclaire as one of the finest hotels in the city, with Ã¢ÂÂthe roof garden one of its most attractive features.Ã¢ÂÂ The roof garden is gone now, but Triumph has done a beautiful job in bringing the rooms of the Belleclaire into the 21st century while maintaining much of the buildingÃ¢ÂÂs original charm.,Every week, get updates on residential real estate news, covering the five boroughs and beyond.,Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.,Invalid email address.

Still, 15 of us have been able to maintain our larger spaces, our leases luckily grandfathered in. Suffice it to say we pay considerably less rent than the going rates here in the Upper West SideÃ¢ÂÂs Golden Triangle.,Advertisement,My apartment has been remodeled through the years Ã¢ÂÂ first by me and more recently with the help of Triumph Ã¢ÂÂ in step with the changes happening throughout the building. I now have a stylish new bathroom with a huge glassed-in shower and a sleek kitchen with tile floors and stainless steel appliances. Though I occasionally miss seeing some of the hookers I had the pleasure of becoming friendly with Ã¢ÂÂ platonically, of course Ã¢ÂÂ in the late 1980s, I feel more relaxed 30 years later with the well-dressed travelers I meet on the elevators.,One of the men working on the job recently told me that he had worked on two new luxury condominium buildings now nearly complete, a bit to the east on West 77th Street. Ã¢ÂÂThose were straightforward, easy,Ã¢ÂÂ he told me. Ã¢ÂÂThe Belleclaire takes a lot of time and consideration. ItÃ¢ÂÂs not a blueprint here. We need to look at the pictures we have gathered of the building from early on and make a match as close as possible.Ã¢ÂÂ With pride, he added, Ã¢ÂÂItÃ¢ÂÂs a landmark building, you know.Ã¢ÂÂ,I do. I havenÃ¢ÂÂt confessed to him IÃ¢ÂÂm a longtime resident. I prefer basking in the delight he exudes when talking about my home.,Ã¢ÂÂCome back and see it when itÃ¢ÂÂs done!Ã¢ÂÂ,I walked away smiling.

When Your Greatest Romance Is a Friendship Advertisement,None,None,Ã¢ÂÂIs this your grandson?Ã¢ÂÂ people sometimes ask Austin when sheÃ¢ÂÂs out with me.,I love watching her vanity prick up, the way she serenely tilts her small white head and refurbishes her Southern accent to correct them. Ã¢ÂÂNo, honey. HeÃ¢ÂÂs my friend.Ã¢ÂÂ,At this point, folks usually smile tightly and turn away, perhaps worried there is more than friendship going on between the old lady and the younger man seated at the bar or strolling through the supermarket, giggling like teenagers.,Why weÃ¢ÂÂre giggling, I couldnÃ¢ÂÂt tell you. Often our mirth seems fueled by some deep-celled delight at being together. Friendship, like its flashier cousin, love, can be wildly chemical and, like love, can happen in an instant.,When I met Austin, I was in my early 40s and not looking for a friend. I had come alone to this small Oregon town to finish a book. So when a bony, blue-eyed stranger knocked on my door, introducing herself as the lady from across the way and wondering if I might like to come over and see her garden Ã¢ÂÂ maybe have a gin and tonic Ã¢ÂÂ I politely declined.,Advertisement,Watching her walk away, though, in her velvet slip-ons and wrinkled blouse, I felt a strange pang, a slow pin of sadness that I suppose could best be described as loneliness. Suddenly I was dashing into the dirt road to say that I was sorry, that she had caught me in the middle of work, but that, yes, I would enjoy seeing her garden.,Ã¢ÂÂNot the gin and tonic?Ã¢ÂÂ she said.,Ã¢ÂÂSure, that too,Ã¢ÂÂ I answered, blushing. And before I could suggest a visit the next week, she said: Ã¢ÂÂSo IÃ¢ÂÂll see you in a few hours, then. Shall we say 4:30?Ã¢ÂÂ,I had to admire her sense of time. Next week is for someone who can afford to put things off. Austin, in her 80s, surely felt no such luxury.,Ã¢ÂÂI liked your face,Ã¢ÂÂ she admitted later, telling me she had spotted me at the mailbox.,As she poured the gin, I told her I had seen her at the mailbox, as well, and liked her face, too.,Ã¢ÂÂI wish I had better eyebrows,Ã¢ÂÂ she said.

That we could be quiet together so soon, and without strain, felt auspicious.,Ã¢ÂÂSo youÃ¢ÂÂve run away from home?Ã¢ÂÂ she said at one point.,From the beginning, there was something about our interaction that reminded me of friendships from childhood, in which no question was off limits. On religion, she claimed to be an atheist. I admitted to being haunted by the ghosts of a Roman Catholic upbringing. She said her sisters believed in hell and worried about her soul. Austin, though, seemed afraid of nothing, least of all death. I said I was still afraid of the dark.,Ã¢ÂÂLiving alone,Ã¢ÂÂ she said. Ã¢ÂÂIt can make you funny.Ã¢ÂÂ,I laughed but changed the subject, telling her I would like to see her paintings.,Later, crossing the road back to my Craigslist sublet, I wondered what I was doing. I reminded myself of my plan: hiding out, staying in the dream of the book. I wasnÃ¢ÂÂt here to socialize. After years of work on a single project, I was in the final stretch. I could finish a draft in a few months and head back home.,Besides, if I wanted a friend during my retreat, I would find someone my age to throw back beers with. Gin and tonics with an old lady in her garden? That wasnÃ¢ÂÂt in the plan.,But there I was the next weekend having dinner with her, and then it was every weekend.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters filled the streets of Washington, D.C., on Saturday for March for Our Lives, calling for action on gun control and school safety reform.

In the weeks since 17 people were killed by a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, students around the country - following the lead of survivors in Parkland, Florida - have walked out of their classrooms to protest gun violence, lobbied lawmakers to pass gun reform legislation, and planned Saturday's mass demonstration.

As students and adults gathered in Washington, D.C., on Saturday morning, more than 800 sibling rallies were set to take place in cities around the world, according to the protest website. Protesters in Washington, New York City and Boston lined up early Saturday, braving unseasonably cold temperatures in the low 40s.

The main stage at the end of March for Our Lives, with the U.S. Capitol in the background, featured music superstars including Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson performing in between speeches by Parkland students. But organizers, in an effort to make their message more inclusive, also asked students from Chicago and Washington, D.C., to speak about how they have been impacted by gun violence.

Perhaps the most powerful was 11-year-old Naomi Wadler, who told the crowd: "I am here today to acknowledge and represent the African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper."

The March for Our Lives was billed as a rally for young people, but the turnout in the nation's capital was a cross-section of the country: students, yes, but also their parents, and adults without children, from places as far as Boston and Seattle and Los Angeles. The crowd was massive, stretching from the foot of the Capitol down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the White House.

At the march in New York City, the crowd was dominated by students, ranging from small children to college students. But there were also adults of every age, many of whom brought their children to the rally.

The White House released a statement supporting the student protesters. "We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the President's, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Acts, and signed them into law," Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement Saturday. "Additionally, on Friday, the Department of Justice issued the rule to ban bump stocks following through on the President's commitment to ban devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns."

President Trump, at his golf resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, tweeted about Friday's terrorist attack in France on Saturday morning, but was silent on the march.

Meanwhile, young people took the stage blocks from the White House, calling on elected officials to do more to stop gun violence.

"My grandfather had a dream that his four little children will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character," said 9-year-old Yolanda Renee King, the granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr, to a cheering crowd. "I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world. Period."


In an interview with CNN later, alongside her father Martin Luther King III, she said her school had a lockdown drill on Friday. "We do all these lockdown drills because it's unfortunate that people have guns and they use them to hurt people," she said.

Parkland survivors speak in Washington, D.C.
David Hogg, a Marjory Stoneman Douglas student and one of the leaders of the #NeverAgain movement, called on the crowd to focus on upcoming midterm elections, urging first-time voters to head to the polls and railing against lawmakers who accept donations from the National Rifle Association.

"We are going to make this the voting issue. We are going to take this to every election, to every state and every city," Hogg said. "When politicians send their thoughts and prayers with no action, we say, 'No more.' And to those politicians supported by the NRA, that allow the continued slaughter of our children and our future, I say get your resumes ready."

"We will not stop until every man, every woman, every child and every American can live without fear of gun violence," he added.

Emma GonzÃ¡lez - the student whose emotional speech just days after the Parkland shooting went viral - stood silent on stage for more than four minutes, tears streaming down her face, as she marked the length of time of the shooting rampage.

"In a little over six minutes, 17 of our friends were taken from us, 15 were injured, and everyone - absolutely everyone in the Douglas community - was forever altered," she said. "Everyone who has been touched by the cold grip of gun violence understands."

"Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job," she said, breaking her silence.

Cameron Kasky, another #NeverAgain leader, called on the crowd to "create a better world" for future generations.

"Look around, we are the change," he told the cheering crowd.

"My generation - having spent our entire lives seeing mass shooting after mass shooting - has learned that our voices are powerful and our votes matter," he said. "We must educate ourselves and start conversations that keep our country moving forward and we will. We hereby promise to fix the broken system we've been forced into and create a better world for the generations to come. Don't worry, we've got this."

Kasky read aloud the names of the students and teachers who were killed in the shooting at his high school last month, pausing to wish senior Nicholas Dworet a happy birthday. The aspiring Olympic swimmer would have turned 18 on Saturday.

At the end of her speech, Parkland shooting survivor Sam Fuentes led the crowd in singing happy birthday to Dworet, bringing many to tears.

Parkland community rallies in Florida
Students, parents and community members also rallied in Parkland, Florida - where students performed emotional tributes to their classmates, and family members of the shooting victims spoke.

The Miami Herald reported tens of thousands of people turned out for the rally and march in the Florida community where a mass shooting started the movement. They gathered at a park near Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

Parkland student Autumn McKinney told the Herald what she wants alleged gunman Nikolas Cruz to know: "Even though he did something terrible, it started something amazing. He didn't win."

Celebrities join students at the march
While student activists took the stage to deliver impassioned calls to action, celebrities joined the crowd and showed their support for the cause as well. Paul McCartney marched in New York City, honoring fellow Beatle John Lennon, who was shot and killed in the city in 1980. Miley Cyrus, Kim Kardashian-West and George and Amal Clooney were among those who participated in Washington, D.C.
idway through the rally for gun control that concluded the March for Our Lives, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas junior Jaclyn Corin brought out a special guest, Yolanda Renee King, the nine-year-old granddaughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., and Coretta Scott King. "I have a dream that enough is enough," Yolanda King said, "and that this should be a gun-free world."

And then, wearing a white coat, with an orange ribbon pinned to it in remembrance, the miniature activist stood before the crowd of thousands with a gap-toothed grin and led them in call-and-response:

Spread the word

("Spread the word!" The thousands gathered shouted in response.)

All across the nation
We are
Going to be
A great generation.

It is, at least, a generation that has now defined itself. Regardless of its long-term effects, the March for Our Lives is the first major statement by Americans born after 1999, who have presented a new template for protest. The March for Our Lives was a massive outcry against extreme violence delivered with a mix of pop sentiment, corporate coÃ¶peration, and an awareness of the socioeconomic privilege that allows certain voices to be heard louder than others. Youth protest today does not look like it did fifty years ago, although that's boring to say. Many of the students came to Washington, D.C., with their parents. Stoneman Douglas students were met by politicians on Capitol Hill. The Washington Wizards invited them to basketball practice. Student journalists held a panel at the Newseum. A concert the night before was thrown in their honor, and Shake Shack sponsored a sign-making party.

The student leaders were grateful, thanking their celebrity donors and corporate sponsors on social media, posing in front of the little blue bird at Twitter's Washington offices. One student even photographed and tweeted the boxes of granola bars and snacks donated by Kind. The media could not love them enough: there were interviews on "60 Minutes," NPR's "Morning Edition," and the late-night news shows. There were major interactive packages in Teen Vogue, and a Time magazine cover. There was, in short, so much consensus about the message of the student movement that it has to be one of the least anti-establishment social movements in American history. What the student leaders seem to be saying is that they don't want trouble, and, had a person not arrived at their school with a gun, they would have kept their heads down and scored high on their S.A.T.s. They have been as polite and as popular as protesters can hope to be, and yet the establishment has continued to prove reluctant to change.

The students marched on Saturday, the day after Congress had departed for its spring recess, and the spending bill that Donald Trump signed on Friday had included three meagre actions to address gun violence: fifty million dollars in grants for school-security measures; attempts to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System; and a clarification of the terms of the Dickey Amendment that will now allow for research into the effects of gun violence (although the amendment still bans the use of government funding to promote gun control). As tens of thousands of people descended on the Capitol to demand measures such as universal background checks and a ban on assault rifles that lawmakers would likely continue to ignore, most of those lawmakers left town. Two days before the march, Jaelynn Willey, a sixteen-year-old student at Great Mills High School, in southern Maryland, died, of the injuries she sustained after another student shot her at school. Adults at the march talked about "standing out of the way" and provided snacks.

"It's about amplifying the voices of current students," Lysee Webb, who graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2003 and now lives in Brooklyn, said. She and her sister, Emma Webb (Class of 2009), were among the hundreds of M.S.D. alumni who gathered the morning of the march in the ballroom at the J. W. Marriott hotel in downtown Washington for a pre-march breakfast. The alumni breakfast was a culmination of fund-raising and organizing efforts that had begun in the immediate aftermath of February 14th, with impressive results: I spoke with a group of students who had just disembarked from a seventeen-hour bus ride from the University of Central Florida, and who would return to the bus again at 6 p.m.

Current Stoneman Douglas students arrived to Washington in all manner of convoys, some on buses, others with their families (the march coincided with spring break). One group travelled to Washington on a plane lent by the New England Patriots. At 4:10 a.m. on Saturday, three planes carrying five hundred and sixty-seven students total departed from Fort Lauderdale. The students were whisked directly from the tarmac to the site of the rally, where they were immediately given a special place in front of the stage, where the media started gathering at seven-thirty to watch them file in. Before the rally, the student speakers came out for twenty minutes of intense questioning. The Parkland students were now joined by a coalition of speakers from all over the country, an effort to emphasize that the weak gun laws that result in school shootings also cause the everyday gun violence to which Americans have shown themselves inured. "We're seeing all these people coming out under one cause; it's really empowering, it's really incredible to see," Delaney Tarr said. "It is a lot, but it's a good version of a lot."

The rally began with a song by Andra Day, who sang about "standing up for something," backed by a children's choir from Baltimore dressed in red uniforms. It was just after noon, the sun was shining, and the mood was ebullient. The singers were joined by Common, who rhymed "When they go low, we stand in the heights" with "I stand for peace, love, and women's rights." After the song, a montage played in which politicians offered thoughts and prayers, followed by another showing the now-familiar narrative of the movement's beginnings. Clips of right-wing political figures intoning that the immediate aftermath of shootings was "not the time for gun control" gave way to student activists in Tallahassee calling for a new kind of response.

After six weeks of familiarizing itself with the faces of Cameron Kasky, Delaney Tarr, Alex Wind, Emma GonzÃ¡lez, and the other members of the Never Again movement, the public was now introduced to a new set of activists. Edna Lisbeth Chavez, a seventeen-year-old youth leader from South Los Angeles, interspersed her speech with phrases in Spanish. She lost her brother to gun violence, and moved the crowd to chant his name, Ricardo. Zion Kelly, seventeen, of Washington, D.C., spoke of his twin brother, Zaire, who was killed by an armed robber as he walked home from school. Zaire Kelly aspired to be a forensic scientist and wanted to attend Florida A. & M. University. Naomi Wadler, an eleven-year-old from Virginia, said that she was speaking for "the African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper, whose stories don't lead on the evening news." She quoted Toni Morrison: "If there is a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, you must be the one to write it." Christopher Underwood, of Brooklyn, lost his fourteen-year-old brother, who was shot and killed as he walked home from a graduation party. "I took my pain and anger and turned it into action," he said. Alex King and D'Angelo McCade, both of Chicago, stepped onstage with tape over their mouths and their fists in the air. Matthew Soto, whose sister died in Newtown, said, "America, I am pleading with you to realize this is not O.K., we do not have to live like this."

There were more video montages. Demi Lovato sang a power ballad about rising from the ground like a skyscraper. Ariana Grande sang that we're going to be all right. Miley Cyrus sang that it's not about reaching the other side of the mountain but about the climb. The stories of students who lost their lives in Newtown and Parkland overlapped with the stories of people who lost their lives to police. The performer Vic Mensa dedicated his song "Now We Could Be Free" to Stephon Clark and Decynthia Clements. A video message from Malala Yousafzai offered support.

The final speaker was Emma GonzÃ¡lez. Her last speech, given at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale, only days after the shooting, had made her a household name, and many of the marchers wore buttons and signs that referred to its refrain: "We call B.S." GonzÃ¡lez was dressed in a green bomber jacket covered with patches and buttons. As she stepped onstage, the crowd went wild. Her speech was short. "In a little over six minutes, seventeen of our friends were taken from us, fifteen were injured, and everyone, absolutely everyone in the Douglas community, was forever altered," she said. "Six minutes and twenty seconds with an AR-15, and my friend Carmen would never complain to me about piano practice; Aaron Feis would never call Kyra 'Miss Sunshine'; Alex Schachter would never walk into school with his brother Ryan; Scott Beigel would never joke around with Cameron at camp; Helena Ramsay would never hang out after school with Max; Gina Montalto would never wave to her friend Liam at lunch; Joaquin Oliver would never play basketball with Sam or Dylan; Alaina Petty would never; Cara Loughran would never; Chris Hixon would never; Luke Hoyer would never; Martin Duque Anguiano would never; Peter Wang would never; Alyssa Alhadeff would never; Jaime Guttenberg would never; Meadow Pollack would never."

Then she stood in silence. Tears streamed down her cheeks. She said nothing. The crowd watched, also silent. A chant of "never again" started, and then faded out. Emma still stood. Finally, the beeping of an electric timer rang out. "Since the time that I came out here it has been six minutes and twenty seconds," she said. "The shooter has ceased shooting and will soon abandon his rifle. He would then stay with the students and walk free for an hour before arrest." She concluded: "Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job."

She turned to the group of students gathered behind her onstage and hugged her friends. The lectern was removed, a gospel choir came out, and Jennifer Hudson led them all in in a rendition of "The Times They Are A-Changin'."
WASHINGTON, D.C. - As hundreds of thousands of gun violence protesters rallied on Pennsylvania Avenue, Virginia high school students Aseal Saed and Yvonne White went to work.

Equipped with an iPhone and a Nikon camera, the duo waded into a sea of signs looking for students to interview. In the shadow of the Newseum - a few blocks from the main stage - they met with a pair of students from Delaware to do a quick interview on what they wanted to get out of the march.

"Let's make a change today," the students told White.

Saed and White are two of the hundreds of student reporters nationwide covering the March for Our Lives in D.C. and its sibling rallies in cities around the U.S. 

Because the March for Our Lives was a student-led movement, student reporters had the ability to provide a different perspective in their coverage than national outlets.

The main march

The main march in D.C. drew hundreds of thousands of supporters and featured 20 speakers - all of whom were children or teenagers - and performances from a number of artists, including Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lin-Manuel Miranda.

Saed, the editor-in-chief for Annandale (Va.) High School's student newspaper, The A-Blast, mapped out her newspaper's coverage on a sheet of paper that she carried around during the march. Her plan was to localize the story by focusing on Annandale students' involvement, but she also wanted to include voices from across the nation.

"We want it to have the unique perspective of specific students so it's not just like another story in The Washington Post," said White, a copy editor and circulation ad manager for The A-Blast. "And so Annandale students can read the story, like, 'Oh, I know that person there. And that's so cool that they are standing up for their rights.' Or, not necessarily agree with it."

Members of The Eagle Eye, the student newspaper at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., spoke at the Newseum on March 23, where they explained their position on the rally and how they've covered the story differently than national outlets.

"I think as a student publication, we have that liberty and that resource to be able to reach out to our students who actually survived this shooting," said Christy Ma, an associate editor for The Eagle Eye. "We have the resources to accurately portray what happened, and be able to tell the stories of what happened."

Rebecca Wessel and Oreet Zimand, two juniors from Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Md. and staff writers for the Silver Chips Online, said student publications are able to relate to students and focus on the angles that students are most interested in

Since the march took place during Montgomery Blair's spring break, Wessel and Zimand planned to interview students who marched in other cities across the country. They also talked with the school's track team, who wore armbands at a meet in support of the movement.

"As a student newspaper, our job is to serve the students," Zimand said. "Our angle is to show their voices, why they're there, and what they believe in. Sometimes, with other media sources, things can get lost."

Some of the student reporters also participated in the rally, carrying signs and joining in the call for change, though students said they worked to create a distinction between their personal beliefs and their reporting.

"We'll be snapping pictures but we'll also be cheering and shouting," said Emma Dowd, The Eagle Eye's co-editor in chief. "We all have personal opinions, so in our covering of the story, we are going to be as neutral as we can be. The facts. What happens. But in our personal lives, many of us feel very passionately about what this movement is aiming towards."

Though she attended the rally as a reporter, Avni Singh, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Va., and the production editor for the school's newspaper, TJ Today, said she experienced a few different emotions while covering the march. She said it was sad hearing people discuss their experiences with gun violence, but she was relieved seeing so many people gathered to rally for change.

"I didn't expect it to affect me as much as it did," Singh said. "I really think everyone should have this experience in their lifetime."

Around the country

With more than 800 sister marches held around the world, student reporters across the nation had the opportunity to cover the historic movement. Journalists at Robinson High School's RHS Today covered their Tampa, Fla. rally.

The school did not allow anyone to promote the rally, said Macy McClintock, an RHS junior and a managing editor for RHS Today. Students were not allowed to hang posters or coordinate buses to the event. The paper decided to make the censorship the story.

"That became the angle, how kids were using their voices even when they're limited," McClintock said.

Another Tampa high school's newspaper had a different approach to its coverage. Marin Fehl, a sophomore page editor at Hillsborough High School's The Red and Black, said she took photos at the event and interviewed the mayor and a state representative. But, overall, Fehl said they wanted the focus to be on student activism.

"A lot of them related to this," Fehl said. "[The shooting] was such close proximity."

Louisiana State University's The Daily Reveille staff covered rallies in the state's two biggest cities: Baton Rouge and New Orleans.

"The biggest thing I told [my reporters] was to ask students 'why are you out here, what inspired you?'" said Evan Saacks, an LSU sophomore and The Daily Reveille's news editor. "I want to tell LSU what is happening. I'd really like to capture LSU's voice and present it in a way they can read it."

In Seattle, The Ballard Talisman from Ballard High School had to work to ensure its coverage was neutral, as some staff members were participating in the march. Those who did participate did not contribute to the reporting, and those out on assignment were there to report but not participate. Senior political correspondent Oscar Zahner said he did not want people who disagreed with the movement's message to feel "sidelined" by their coverage.

"Objective coverage is the best way to give the movement exposure," Zahner said.

Working with professionals

While most student journalists covered the events for their own school publications, others were able to share their reporting with commercial news outlets.

Staff members of The Eagle Eye were featured as guest editors with Britain's The Guardian for its rally coverage, while reporters for The Wilson Beacon at Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in D.C. worked with The Huffington Post, who tagged and tweeted the Beacon to their 11.5 million followers.

"The best part is definitely all the Twitter notifications," said junior Maya Wilson, the features editor at The Wilson Beacon.
WASHINGTON - Marjory Stoneman Douglas senior Emma Gonzalez stood silent, with tears streaming down her face, on a stage in front of thousands at Saturday's March for Our Lives.

After listing the names of the 17 people killed when a gunman rampaged through her school on Valentine's Day, Gonzalez asked the crowd to fathom how so many could be murdered in only 6 minutes and 20 seconds.

And then she stopped speaking.

Silent minutes ticked by. Then an alarm beeped.
"Since the time that I came out here, it has been 6 minutes and 20 seconds," she said finally. "The shooter has ceased shooting, and will soon abandon his rifle, blend in with the students as they escape and walk free for an hour before arrest."

She added: "Fight for your lives before it's someone else's job."

In the 39 days since the shooting in Parkland, Florida, Gonzalez and her fellow student survivors have galvanized a nationwide movement for gun reform.

On Saturday, hundreds of thousands of students gathered in the nation's capital and at sister marches across the country and around the world to deliver a powerful, unified message: Enough is enough.


Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School organized and hosted the main event on the mall in Washington with the U.S. Capitol in the background, a stark reminder of why they were demanding change.

"We hereby promise to fix the broken system we've been forced into and create a better world for the generations to come," Cameron Kasky, one of the student organizers, told a cheering crowd filled with teenagers. "Don't worry, we've got this."

The Washington rally featured 20 student speakers, numerous famous musicians and the Stoneman Douglas Drama Club, which performed its original song, "Shine," with the student choir. Organizers estimated that 800,000 people attended the march.

Across the country, there were more than two dozen marches that occurred in large cities, including New York, Miami, Cincinnati, Houston, Atlanta, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh. Rallies were also held around the world in Israel, New Zealand, Australia, the U.K., Japan, Belgium, India, France and Chile.

In total, organizers estimated there were approximately 800 marches organized on Friday and Saturday - even one in Antarctica.

In Washington, rally-goers were chanting "Vote them out! Vote them out!" before the event began. Hundreds of homemade signs were held up above the crowd: "Stop the madness/vote them out." Another said, "18th century law can't regulate 21st century weapons." And another put it bluntly: "What's worth more? Your children or your guns?"

But Parkland survivor Jaclyn Corin said Saturday's rally was also about recognizing that gun violence is a nationwide problem.

"We recognize that Parkland received more attention because of its affluence," she said. "But we share this stage today and forever with those communities who have always stared down the barrel of a gun."

Trevon Bosley, 19, talked about the gun violence in Chicago that killed his brother Terrell Bosley on the way to church in April 2006. He said that these gun deaths are tied to the White House and American political leadership.

"When you have a president that would rather constantly talk about and belittle Chicago's violence rather than send funds and resources, you have gun violence," Bosley said.

"It's time for the nation to realize gun violence is more than just a Chicago problem or Parkland problem but an America problem," he added.

But it wasn't just recent graduates and high school students who took the stage on Saturday. Naomi Wadler, 11, of Alexandria, Virginia, spoke as well. She led a walkout at her elementary school on March 14.

"It's time for the nation to realize gun violence is more than just a Chicago problem or Parkland problem but an America problem."
"I'm here today to represent the African-American girls [killed by gun violence] who don't always make the front pages of the newspapers," she said. The crowd roared in response.

"My friends and I might still be 11, we might still be in elementary school, but we know," she added. "We know life isn't equal for everyone and we know what is right and wrong. We also know that we stand in the shadow of the Capitol and we know that we have seven short years until we, too, have the right to vote."

The rally also memorialized the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, as Christopher Underwood, 11 - who lost his older brother to gun violence in Brooklyn, New York - reminded the crowd that the civil rights icon's death was the result of gun violence.

Those in attendance were surprised when King's granddaughter, Yolanda Renee King, 9, later came to the stage alongside Stoneman Douglas junior class president Jaclyn Corin with a microphone.

"My grandfather had a dream that his four children would not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character," she said. "I have a dream that enough is enough and that this should be a gun-free world. Period."

By the early afternoon, the march in Washington had drawn hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country. Participants arrived hours ahead of the noon start-time on Saturday to get a spot toward the stage, where Miley Cyrus, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt and Ariana Grande performed.

Lawmakers from the House and Senate left Washington on Thursday for a two week-recess marking Easter and Passover. Numerous Democratic lawmakers remained for the event, however, including Florida lawmakers Sen. Bill Nelson and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

President Trump left on Friday evening for his Mar-a-Lago property in Palm Beach, Florida. A White House spokeswoman released a statement prior to the event.

"We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today. Keeping our children safe is a top priority of the President's, which is why he urged Congress to pass the Fix NICS and STOP School Violence Acts, and signed them into law," Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.

Stoneman Douglas survivor Delaney Tarr said the current legislation offered was not nearly enough.

"We are not here for bread crumbs; we are here for real change," she said. "We are here to lead, we are here to call out every single politician to force them into enacting this legislation."

The power of the moment was not lost on the thousands of students, teachers and parents in attendance.

"To anybody who thinks their voice doesn't matter, it does," Samantha Goldberg, a 17-year-old student at Stoneman Douglas, said as she was walking to the rally Saturday. "Every single voice comes together and makes a huge impact. This is just the beginning. This march is the first step in a long process, but ultimately there's going to be a huge change. I mean, there's not half a million people here for nothing."

Michelle Lo Brutto traveled to the march in Manhattan on Saturday with her family and her cousins from their home in Old Bridge, New Jersey. Around her neck she wore a sign demanding gun control in memory of her sister, Cristina.

In 2012, a gunman, armed with an AK-47, opened fire inside the supermarket where he worked with Cristina Lo Brutto. Cristina, 18, and her colleague Bryan Breen, 24, were both shot and killed. The gunman later killed himself.

"He had severe mental health issues and was hospitalized three times and he was still able to buy [a gun] legally," Michelle Lo Brutto said. "I think everyone has just had enough, they're just tired of seeing people they love get hurt or killed and they just don't want to be the next one."

Many in attendance felt they had been impacted by gun violence in one form or another, and said they were tired of the status quo.

"Sandy Hook happened not too far from my hometown several years ago," said Sophie Zipoli, a high school senior who traveled to Washington from Burlington, Connecticut. "After that, I thought there'd be some significant change, yet here we are years later and there still so many mass shootings and school violence."

Chicago native Ke'Shon Newman's 16-year-old brother was shot and killed a few blocks away from his home in Chicago's south side. Now, the 15-year-old routinely checks an app on his phone that tracks gun deaths in his city.

Newman told MSNBC that he traveled to Washington Saturday, to not only demand safety for students in America's classroom, but an end to gun violence in general.

"I just want the world to be a more safe environment for everyone, this march today is going to bring more awareness around the country," he said. "Let's just stop all the gun violence in this country and let's get to action."

Teachers and parents also attended the rally and they were not shy about sharing their opinions on gun violence.

"It's unacceptable to me that our children live in fear of something like what's been going on in our schools," said Deb Sheridan, an eighth grade teacher from Leesburg, Virginia. "We need to address gun control issues and make our children feel safe in schools - that's the one place that they should be going in and looking for an education, not worrying about their safety."

Richard McDonald, 70, came from Detroit to Washington to visit his granddaughter and bring her to the March.

"I know that they're not fully engaged," he said of Trump and Congress, "and I think the only way to [create change] is to keep demonstrating that the public is against more guns. The idea of arming teachers is insane and it's not going to make things any better. What makes things better is not having guns at all."
Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets around the country for March for Our Lives, student-initiated demonstrations to demand government action to reduce gun violence in the wake of the latest major mass school shootings in Parkland, Fla.  

In Washington, the student-driven event in Washington drew a mix of entertainers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande, and Common. George Clooney, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Steven Spielberg attended, along with other celebrities like Cher. A number of industry figures donated to the event, including Clooney, Katzenberg, Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey.

A standout moment came when Emma Gonzalez, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who has been one of the leaders of the activist effort that has followed the mass shooting, paused during her speech until six minutes, 20 seconds had elapsed since she started it. That was the length of time it took the shooter to kill 17 victims at the high school. As she said nothing, the crowd stayed silent, save for a brief chant of, "Never again."

No politicians spoke at the event, and the musicians who appeared largely kept their statements to messages contained within their music.

Instead, the roster of speakers were almost entirely students from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School high school and other teenagers who have been impacted by gun violence. They included youth from inner-city schools and neighborhoods where shootings are rampant but get little national media attention.

One of the students told the crowd that this was "not Coachella," referring to the popular music festival, and that it was instead a serious event honoring the victims of gun violence and demanding political action.

"I have a dream that enough is enough. And that this should be a gun-free world, period," said Yolanda Renee King, the granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr., who was killed by an assassin 50 years ago on April 4.

The event also was heavily focused on getting young people more politically active and registered to vote as they turn 18, as a way of holding politicians accountable for not taking action on guns. There were many references to the strength of the National Rifle Association lobby, and to Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) for taking money from the group.

"If you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking," said David Hogg, another Parkland student who helped organize the march.

He added, "We're going to make this the voting issue. We're going to take this to every election, to every state, and every city."

A video during the event showed NRA officials, like Wayne LaPierre and Dana Loesch, as well as Charlton Heston, then the president of the organizations, saying, "From my cold dead hands." In the crowd the images drew boos and the bird.

The White House missed a statement saying, "We applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today." President Trump was in Mar-a-Lago for the weekend.

Zion Kelly appeared on stage and described the events that led to the gun shooting death of his twin brother, Zaire, while walking home in northeast Washington. He asked the crowd to raise hands if they have been impacted by gun violence. Many went up.

"Just like you, I have had enough," he said.

The march ended with Jennifer Hudson singing "The Times They Are a Changin," Bob Dylan's standard that was an anthem of the protest era of the 1960s.

The march was more of a rally than an actual walk from the White House to the Capitol, in large part due to the size of the space. By the time it started at noon, almost the entire length was filled with participants.

Security was heavy, as authorities closed off streets and erected an elaborate system of barricades along Pennsylvania Avenue. But there was no screening through metal detectors.

Ellie d'Alessandro, 19, of Fairfax, Va., held a sign that read "I don't know enough about guns to demand regulation?" Below was drawn a diagram of the female reproductive system. "I'll wait," it read. She said that she wanted to combine a message from the Women's March, which she attended last year, with the march to end gun violence.

"There is no excuse for this. It is just ridiculous," she said of the Parkland shootings. "People shouldn't be afraid to walk out of their houses and go to school, school is supposed to be a safe place."

She said that she hopes that something comes out of the march. "I want people to stop arguing and get something done," she said. "There are so many different opinions, so many different things people are saying. You just need to come together and compromise."

Nearby, John Brown of New Jersey held a sign that read "#Grandparents: Common sense versus NRA/GOP."

Brown, 71, who is retired, said that he and his wife Ann, a school teacher, supported calls for greater restriction of weapons after the Newtown, Conn., shooting massacre in 2012. They went to one of the funerals for one of the girls killed in Newtown, who was a cousin of one of Ann's students.

"Our philosophy and belief in life is that this is not the way our country should be running," Ann said. "We should not have these weapons of war available to all of us."

After Newtown, she added, "things didn't change. Things never changed." But, she said, "you can't lose hope. You have to keep trying."

"I am so, so grateful and delighted that politicians were not allowed," said Margie White, of the Washington DC area. "They are they cause of so much of this. To have their here would just besmirch the whole thing in my opinion, taking away from the kids and what they are trying to do."

Clarence Hoop, 69, of Virginia, said that "we finally have a group that is willing to speak up which we have ignored for years, and even though we had a ban on military type of weapons for 10 years, Congress let it dissolve, so we are here we are repeating history again, once again killing off our kids. This is something that has got to stop."

Hoop worked at the Pentagon for 42 years and recalled watching the student demonstrations of the Vietnam war in the 1960s, but he thinks these students are more effective.

"They have the funding and they are going to keep this up and I think they will succeed," he said.

He said that "these kids have to resources that they will keep coming back and coming back to remind us, and that is what we need. Those reminders."

In New York City, Paul McCartney joined protesters near the Dakota Building where fellow Beatle John Lennon was killed by a gunman in 1980.

Marchers chanted "NRA sashay away," at the New York rally, holding posters decrying the involvement of the National Rifle Association in government.

Maria Shriver attended the demonstration and March For Our Lives event in downtown Los Angeles, where Amy Schumer was also present. Shriver and Schumer chatted and posed for pictures with survivors of the Parkland High mass shooting.


In an interview with Variety, Shriver said the gun control debate has a renewed energy and a very different feel than times past.

"It feels much more 'of the people,'" she said. "It feels much more inclusive, it feels much more multigenerational. These are all young people who are going to vote. I think that's going to have an impact on people who are up for re-election this coming year in the midterms."

Shriver said the movement has focused on where it can most be effective - registering teens when they turn 18.

"Young people in these marches have very specific asks. It's not so general," she said.

The spate of school shootings that have claimed an increasing number of lives since Columbine, Sandy Hook Elementary, and many others have created new activists.

"There's a lot more people involved that never cared about this issue before," she said. "I lost members of my family to gun violence. This has been an issue that I've grown up with, but it's across generations now and it has a different heat to it, a different energy to it."

Willow Shields, 17, attended Saturday's rally at Grand Park, part of the thousands of teens who demonstrated in downtown Los Angeles. She clutched a sign that read "Books not bullets," and said that she is eager to turn 18 so she can exercise her right to vote.

"People are finally realizing the strength that young people have," Shields said. "This is really driven by teenagers."

She said she admires the Parkland High student activists and others who have become outspoken after experience a shooting. "These kids that are putting themselves out there and having to relive this stuff every day and deal with it, they're doing it for the better of the future for all of us."

At the Washington march, Kiki Baker, 17, of Vienna, Va., was with two other teenage friends, Haylie Roberts, 17, of Pensacola, Fla. and Kayla Ogden, 17, of Naples, Fla. A junior in high school, Baker held a sign that read, "We are students, not targets."

"Especially after Parkland, it has got to stop," Baker said. "This is the time to do it. If not now, then when?"

She added, "This is something that will spark a lot of change, and inspire a lot of people. So I think it is an amazing day, and I think it will go down in history."

Andy Spahn, whose political strategy firm represents Spielberg and Katzenberg, tweeted out a photo of their meeting with the students.

The NRA posted a video on its Facebook page Saturday that included the note, "Today's protests aren't spontaneous. Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the Second Amendment and strip us of our right to defend ourselves and our loved ones."


The student survivors of February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. are proving that more than any activists in a generation, they have managed to take over the conversation around gun control and American safety.

"The world failed us and we're here to make a new one that's going to be easier on the next generation. If you're against that, then get out," Cameron Kasky, March For Our Lives co-founder told Time magazine in a new cover story.

Today, at least a half-million people, most prominently students, are expected to gather for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. and over 800 sister marches across the world.

Organizing the march along with Kasky are survivors Emma GonzÃ¡lez, David Hogg, Jacklyn Corinn, Alex Wind and Ryan Deitsch, all of whom have emphasized their mission to "demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues."

"The adults know that we're cleaning up their mess," Kasky told Time.

Today's March For Our Lives event is just one way the Stoneman Douglas students have mobilized since the February tragedy. Thousands of people across America took part in the #Enough National School Walkout on Wednesday, March 14 to both honor those killed at the high school in February and fight for stricter gun laws.

"These students are trying to build a different kind of world and correct a lot the mistakes people in previous generations made," Columbia University professor Ed Morales, author of the upcoming book "Latinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture," tells CNBC Make It.

Morales argues that GonzÃ¡lez, one of the most vocal student survivors, and her emblematic Gen Z peers (Americans born between 1994 and 2010) have succeeded in leading the March For Our Lives movement because of their youth, protest style and ability to hold inclusive conversations.

GonzÃ¡lez, an 18-year-old senior at Stoneman Douglas, directly called out President Donald Trump and the National Rifle Association (NRA) at an anti-gun rally held days after the mass shooting. A week later, GonzÃ¡lez and fellow survivors again criticized the NRA and lawmakers at a CNN town hall on gun violence.

And their efforts are showing: New results from a Gallup poll conducted after the Stoneman Douglas shooting found that support for stricter laws on gun sales is at its highest since 1993.

Here are three ways GonzÃ¡lez and her Gen Z peers are pioneering change when so many who came before them failed, according to Morales.

They're protesting to prevent further mass shootings
In an interview of the five students on 60 Minutes that aired on March 18, CBS News correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi asked them how their protest could be different than the parents who made it their life's mission to get real change after the Sandy Hook mass shooting.

"The thing about it is we are the generation that's had to be trapped in closets, waiting for police to come or waiting for a shooter to walk into our door. We are the people who know what it's like first-hand," Wind said.

The student survivors of February's mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. are proving that more than any activists in a generation, they have managed to take over the conversation around gun control and American safety.

"The world failed us and we're here to make a new one that's going to be easier on the next generation. If you're against that, then get out," Cameron Kasky, March For Our Lives co-founder told Time magazine in a new cover story.

Today, at least a half-million people, most prominently students, are expected to gather for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. and over 800 sister marches across the world.

Organizing the march along with Kasky are survivors Emma GonzÃ¡lez, David Hogg, Jacklyn Corinn, Alex Wind and Ryan Deitsch, all of whom have emphasized their mission to "demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues."

"The adults know that we're cleaning up their mess," Kasky told Time.

"The thing about it is we are the generation that's had to be trapped in closets, waiting for police to come or waiting for a shooter to walk into our door. We are the people who know what it's like first-hand," Wind said.


"We're the mass shooting generation," Kasky added. "I was born months after Columbine. I'm 17 years old, and we've had 17 years of mass shootings."

Morales explains that while politicians in Congress and coalitions of victims' families have pushed for gun law reform after mass shootings, they haven't had the same unprecedented success in getting their voices heard like these high school students.

"This is the first time that there is a mass movement among pre-college students, staging walkouts and protests in the manner that has been done about other issues in the past," Morales says.

Citing the American immigration rights movement, the anti-apartheid movement, AIDS activism and the protests against American involvement in the Vietnam War, Morales says those were protests primarily led by victims directly affected by these particular issues.

"One of the reasons why the protest movement against the Vietnam War in the 1960s was so massive is that everyone was exposed to this universal draft and there was a real a danger to [men] that might be drafted," Morales says. "Now, we're at this place where mass shootings are so common that young people feel [shootings] are almost as much a threat to their lives."

With regard to Wednesday's high school walkouts, Morales says he's "not trying to diminish [previous movements]," but today's students are leading a "preventative movement" to avoid becoming victims of another tragedy.

"They want to put strong pressure on Congress to change laws. They're offering different suggestions like banning bump stocks, high capacity automatic weapons, enforcing an age limit and a background check law," Morales says. "They're trying to put pressure and force action."

On Friday, GonzÃ¡lez shared an op-ed for Teen Vogue in which she repurposed the Preamble to the Constitution in honor of the #NeverAgain movement and today's march:

They're using social media and their youth to create change
"People always say, 'Get off your phones,' but social media is our weapon," Corin told Time. "Without it, the movement wouldn't have spread this fast."

Stoneman Douglas student survivors have primarily used social media to rally the public around hashtags such as #NeverAgain, #March4OurLives and #DouglasStrong.

Morales says Gen Z's activism on social media and their youth helps them enact change so quickly.

"As millennials raise their concerns, it seems like they're being taken up in a more activist fashion by Generation Z. These [Parkland] students are very motivated and are not compromising," Morales said.

He argues millennials and Gen Z hold more progressive views since they face job insecurity and less opportunity to accumulate wealth than older generations.

"PEOPLE ALWAYS SAY, 'GET OFF YOUR PHONES,' BUT SOCIAL MEDIA IS OUR WEAPON."
-Jaclyn Corin, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School junior class president
Morales adds that Gen Z is better equipped to lead the March For Our Lives movement because millennials are, quite frankly, getting older and are busy being "successful adults" with families. That doesn't leave "a lot of time to be involved in direct action or confrontational politics," he says.

"They have less to lose by devoting a lot of time to [activism]," says Morales.

They're sparking an inclusive conversation
GonzÃ¡lez's strong sense of self and identity shines through as a defining characteristic of the most vocal Douglas Stoneman students.

She begins her Harper's Bazaar op-ed by stating her name and saying, "I'm 18 years old, Cuban and bisexual," but concludes, "none of this matters anymore" in light of the tragedy.

Intersectionality, a term first coined by civil rights activistKimberlÃ© Crenshaw, was designed to fight for the rights of marginalized women, such as African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, in the midst of male-dominated liberation movements.

Morales says that GonzÃ¡lez is clearly aware of intersectionality and different political causes, thanks to the convergence of her Latina identity and millennials' growing focus on inclusivity.

"What you see with Emma is someone who is aware that she's Cuban, aware that she's a woman and aware that she is bisexual and she sees all those things as continuous and intersecting, that these issues should all be thought about together," Morales says. "She's able to juggle a series of interlocking problems and work on all of them at once, rather than just feel like she has to focus on one at the expense of the other."

In order to see political change, Morales argues, people need to understand the challenges different groups of people face. He says GonzÃ¡lez and her peers are doing exactly that.

"Emma is capable of a large series of interlocking problem-solving things that she has in her life," he says, "and she's able to juggle all of them and work on all of them at once rather than just feeling like she has to focus on one at the expense of the other."

Earlier this month GonzÃ¡lez and the members of March For Our Lives met with students from Chicago, one of the country's cities with the most gun-related crimes, to talk about their experiences.

"Young people are much more equipped to see the world today. Twenty years ago, you had to struggle just to come up with the language to describe what all these [intersecting] issues meant, but now you can expect an article in Teen Vogue on it and you can see it all over social media," Morales says. "It's exciting."
