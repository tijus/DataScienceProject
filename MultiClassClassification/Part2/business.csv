business,Patagonia v. Trump The outdoor retailer has supported grass-roots environmental activists for decades. Now it is suing the president in a bid to protect Bears Ears National Monument. None Supported by None VENTURA  Calif. — The offices of Patagonia occupy a low-slung complex of stucco buildings in this sleepy beachside town in Southern California. There are solar panels and picnic tables in the parking lot  day care with a jungle gym by the main lobby and easy access to the beach  where employees surf during lunch break. It is a corporate Eden of sorts  where idealistic Californians run a privately held company that sells about $1 billion of puffy down jackets and organic cotton jeans each year. But on an unseasonably hot and windy Monday morning in early December  Patagonia headquarters were transformed into something that quickly resembled a war room. There were emergency conference calls with Washington lawyers. Court filings were prepared. Web designers remade the company’s home page. It wasn’t a business crisis that had mobilized the company  however. It was politics. None Mr. Trump said the decision was about reducing federal overreach. “Some people think that the natural resources of Utah should be controlled by a small handful of very distant bureaucrats located in Washington ” he said. “And guess what. They’re wrong.” Yet to the tribal groups and conservationists who had been monitoring the situation  including Patagonia  the decision realized some of their worst fears: that the Trump administration would be waging an assault on public lands  and potentially opening up protected areas to drilling and mining. Patagonia was as ready for this moment as any company could be. For more than 45 years  the company has mixed business and politics to a degree unusual in corporate America. While companies are expected to weigh in on everything from gun control to transgender rights these days — and many do so uncomfortably — Patagonia has been unapologetically political since the 1970s. It bills itself “the Activist Company” and publicly advocates for environmental protection  fair trade and stricter labor standards. It supports thousands of grass-roots environmental activists  and has been involved with Bears Ears since 2012. But until December  Patagonia had never tangled with a president. That Monday morning  about 50 Patagonia employees gathered in a conference room to watch Mr. Trump’s speech. The mood was somber. Then  within an hour of the president’s remarks  Patagonia updated the home page of its website. Instead of promotional images advertising colorful products  there was a stark message against a black background: “The President Stole Your Land.” At the same time  Patagonia’s legal team set into motion a plan that had been in the works for months: It would sue the president. Working with a handful of local groups and the law firm Hogan Lovells  Patagonia filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Washington. The lawsuit named as defendants Mr. Trump  Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke  the secretary of agriculture  the director of the Bureau of Land Management and the chief of the Forest Service. And the argument was simple: The Antiquities Act of 1906 gave presidents the power to create national monuments. But it did not grant the power to reduce them. “For as much authority as it gave to the president to create these monuments  Congress gave the president no authority to revoke or modify those monuments ” the lawsuit reads. “Congress is the sole authority that can undertake such changes.” None The barbs only stiffened Patagonia’s resolve. The company’s founder went on CNN and called the Trump administration “evil.” And Rose Marcario  Patagonia’s chief executive officer  made the protection of Bears Ears one of her top priorities. “We’ve always given to grass-roots organizations  it’s part of our D.N.A. ” she said in a recent interview at company headquarters  an American flag flying outside her window. “But the fight got a lot more urgent after the election. This was totally unheard-of.” It would have been enough for one day if Patagonia had just been caught up in a public spat with the president. But hours after Mr. Trump’s announcement  a more urgent crisis emerged: A brush fire was reported in Santa Paula  Calif.  a small community not far from Patagonia’s headquarters. The hot  dry Santa Ana winds blowing that day whipped the fire into an inferno  and much of Ventura was soon evacuated. At the very moment Patagonia was preparing to sue the president  its campus was shut down indefinitely and employees fled their homes. “We did a lot of scenario planning for the lawsuit ” said Corley Kenna  Patagonia’s head of communications. “We didn’t put on the list that life-threatening fires would be happening at the same time.” Patagonia was founded by Yvon Chouinard  an enigmatic mountain climber with an interest in Zen Buddhism and a passion for the environment. In 1957  he taught himself to blacksmith  and began making and selling climbing gear that was less damaging to the rocks he and his buddies were scaling in Yosemite National Park. Within a few years  he had set up shop in Ventura and was doing a brisk business selling clothing for outdoor enthusiasts. He eventually called the company Patagonia  a homage to the vast mountainous region at the southern tip of South America  where he had recently traveled. Patagonia developed a cult following and expanded its offerings. But for the most part  the company was a means to an end  a source of funds that enabled Mr. Chouinard and his friends to surf  climb and travel their way around the world. That changed in 1972  when Mr. Chouinard attended a City Council meeting to hear about development plans along the Ventura River. Under a proposal being considered  the flow of the river would have been changed  and a prized surf break could have been ruined. At the meeting  it looked as if the development would proceed. Then a young environmental activist  Mark Capelli  took the floor. He presented a slide show and argued that the proposed changes would harm the birds  water snakes and muskrats in the estuary. The development was halted  the river was protected  and the surf break was preserved. Mr. Chouinard befriended Mr. Capelli and began to support his work  giving free office space to his nascent organization  Friends of the Ventura River  and helping to fend off several more attempts to develop the river. That set the template. Patagonia would offer small grants to local activists  give in-kind support through marketing know-how and business savvy  and amplify their message with customers. Mr. Chouniard also resolved to give one percent of Patagonia’s sales to support environmental activism. None None “Patagonia has established a unique role in the political and policy ecosystem  and are willing to be very public about their advocacy ” said Neil Kornze  who was a director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Barack Obama and now runs an environmental consulting firm. “They are a group of avid environmentalists who just happen to sell coats.” Business is booming under Ms. Marcario. A former private equity executive who walked away from finance to study Buddhist meditation in India for two years  Ms. Marcario joined Patagonia in 2008 as chief financial officer  drawn to the company’s environmental activism. “That’s why I’m not on Wall Street right now making a ton of money ” she said. “I’m kind of worried about the planet.” She was named chief executive in 2014  and has overseen Patagonia’s continued expansion. Revenues and profits have quadrupled over the past 10 years  according to the company. None None And the company maintains a team of 18 people focused on supporting activism and distributing grants. Since 1985  Patagonia has given away some $90 million to environmental causes. “Science without activism is dead science ” Mr. Chouinard said in a recent interview. “We want to fund the little activist organizations that are out there on the front lines  the grandmothers in front of the bulldozers.” In 2012  one of the little activist organizations that Patagonia supported for the first time was Friends of Cedar Mesa  a small nonprofit organization advocating for the protection of a wide swath of sensitive desert in southern Utah  including the area that would become Bears Ears. At the time  Republicans in Utah  notably Representative Rob Bishop  were intensifying efforts to reduce federal protections of some lands in the state. Doing so could open the door for more oil and gas drilling and uranium mining  bringing in additional state tax revenue. None “Patagonia has been interested in this area for a long time ” Mr. Ewing said. “More than any company I’ve ever seen  they put their money where their mouth is.” As Patagonia learned more about Bears Ears  which was a favorite of rock climbers  it came to appreciate the area’s significance. Sacred land to tribal groups and home to Hopi and Navajo ruins and petroglyphs carved into rock walls  it was a largely unspoiled terrain that could be threatened by expanded drilling and mining. “As we got more involved  we recognized the cultural and spiritual importance of the place ” said Lisa Pike Sheehy  Patagonia’s vice president of environmental activism. “This was a place that should have been protected 50 years ago.” In total  Patagonia has spent some $2 million on efforts to protect Bears Ears  including making grants to nonprofit groups  producing films and other marketing materials  and buying television ads. And at least for a brief moment  they worked. None “We never got the chance to celebrate the monument being created ” Mr. Ewing said. “The writing was on the wall. There wasn’t ever a moment when we thought the monument was safe.” Inside Patagonia  Ms. Marcario and her staff knew their resolve would soon be tested. On the morning after Mr. Trump’s election  Ms. Marcario sent out an all-staff email. “Defending our air  soil and water has never been more important ” she wrote. “In the last few years  our voice and reach has grown louder and stronger … we won’t stop.” None During a monthslong public comment period  the Interior Department received more than two million submissions  the majority of them supporting the continued protection of public lands. Patagonia said its customers had submitted more than 150 000 comments. During the first months of the new administration  Ms. Marcario and another Patagonia employee  Hans Cole  made numerous attempts to meet with Mr. Zinke as part of outdoor industry delegations  according to internal Interior Department emails reviewed by The Times. No meeting with Mr. Zinke ever took place  but Mr. Cole joined two meetings with Interior Department staff. Around this time  Patagonia also began planning for its eventual lawsuit. It enlisted Hogan Lovells  which tracked developments on the issue and organized a weekly conference call for the eventual plaintiffs. None None The retailers added an economic argument to the campaign to protect Bears Ears: Outdoor recreation contributes more than $12 billion annually to the Utah economy  spending that could be jeopardized if public lands are developed. None That evening  Ms. Marcario was driving north along the California coast  returning home from a business trip. As she approached Patagonia’s headquarters  she could see flames encircling Ventura. “I saw the whole ridge line on fire ” she said. “I realized we wouldn’t be able to go back to the office.” Patagonia enacted its emergency plan overnight. Employees were instructed to stay away from campus  and the company offered to pay for accommodations for anyone who had to evacuate. A skeleton crew stayed behind at Patagonia  putting out spot fires as they flared up on campus. The fire spread  surrounding Ventura and consuming hospitals and apartment buildings on the outskirts of town. “There was ash falling like rain ” Ms. Marcario said. “It was something I have never seen before.” None Mr. Zinke hit back. “You mean Patagonia made in China?” he said on a press call  accusing the company of playing politics in a gambit to sell more clothes. “I think it’s shameful and appalling that they would blatantly lie in order to gain money in their coffers.” Then on Fox Business Network  Mr. Zinke took issue with Patagonia’s activism. “They should focus on how to bring manufacturing back to this country  rather than lying to the public about losing federal land ” he said. None None As Patagonia and Trump supporters traded barbs  the blaze  known as the Thomas Fire  became the largest wildfire in modern California history. Burning for more than a month  it destroyed more than 1 000 structures and forced the evacuation of some 100 000 people. Downtown Ventura and the Patagonia campus were spared  but five employees lost their homes. With the fire still burning out of control on Dec. 6  Ms. Marcario was working from her home in Montecito  30 minutes north of headquarters. Friends and employees who had fled were staying with her  though Ms. Marcario would later be forced to evacuate  too. “Then in the middle of what felt like the apocalypse  across my inbox comes an email ” she said. “Patagonia versus Donald Trump  et al.” Ms. Marcario placed a call to her executive team and informed it that she had approved the lawsuit. Patagonia was suing the president. Since that week in December  the feud between Patagonia and the Trump administration has continued to simmer. None None None “The decision was nothing more than a political favor ” Ms. Sheehy  the company’s vice president of environmental activism  wrote in a blog post. “The redrawing of boundaries was deliberate  and directly influenced by an industry that spends millions of dollars lobbying the government to get what it wants.” The Trump administration has not formally responded to the lawsuit filed by Patagonia and the other plaintiffs. Heather Swift  a spokeswoman for the Interior Department  said in an email that claims that the redrawing of boundaries was motivated by oil and gas interests were “patently and demonstrably false.” Ms. Marcario draws a link between the extraction and consumption of fossil fuels and the Thomas Fire  which some climate scientists believe was made worse by climate change. “These are climate disasters  and they’re going to get worse and worse ” Ms. Marcario said. “We have an administration that isn’t paying any attention to that.” None Patagonia’s lawsuit against Mr. Trump is currently tied up in the courts. It has been consolidated with two other cases filed by separate groups  and the government has asked a judge in Washington to transfer the case to Utah. There is no deadline for that decision  and until then  all proceedings in the case are stayed. Hogan Lovells  which has 25 lawyers working the case on a pro bono basis  has billed $1.7 million in hours to date. In the meantime  the area originally protected by Bears Ears National Monument is available for commercial use  including drilling and mining  though there hasn’t yet been any new development. At Patagonia  Ms. Sheehy said that while the company would see its suit against the president through to the end  it had an expansive time horizon when it came to environmental protection. “These are all long fights ” she said. “We’re in this for 50 years  100 years.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/05/business/patagonia-trump-bears-ears.html
business,‘He’s a Pit Bull’: T-Mobile C.E.O. Is the Colorful Outlier of Wireless Advertisement Supported by None At the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas  T-Mobile’s chief executive  John Legere  crashed the AT&T party at the Venetian hotel. Wearing a black leather jacket and his customary pink T-Mobile T-shirt  Mr. Legere said he was just hoping to see the rapper Macklemore perform. None Since taking over T-Mobile in 2012  Mr. Legere has made a name for himself with those kinds of publicity stunts — promoting his own brand while undermining the competition. But now  Mr. Legere may have truly crashed the party. None Under the terms of the proposed deal  Mr. Legere would become chief executive of the combined company  which would keep the T-Mobile name. It’s a bold move  and one that illustrates Mr. Legere’s willingness to disrupt the status quo  even if he appears to have the weaker hand. “He wants to take on the titans of AT&T and Verizon ” said Steve Grasso  director of institutional sales at Stuart Frankel and a market analyst for CNBC  who knows Mr. Legere socially. “He’s a pit bull.” The combination of T-Mobile and Sprint has been years in the making  as both companies have sought to add scale and compete with their larger rivals. Yet the last time the companies formally attempted a deal  in 2014  it was Sprint that was planning to acquire T-Mobile. That deal fell apart in the face of regulatory scrutiny. And since then  Mr. Legere has managed to build T-Mobile’s business by flouting convention. Under his leadership  T-Mobile began offering unlimited data  reduced prices and less stringent contract commitments. When Mr. Legere took over in 2012  he was a very different executive  and T-Mobile was a very different company. T-Mobile was reeling from a failed attempt to sell itself to AT&T and struggling to distinguish itself from other low-cost carriers like Sprint and Metro PCS. Mr. Legere  who spent 20 years working at AT&T  was a conventional  if ambitious  telecommunications executive. “He was a finance guy ” said Dan Hesse  the former chief executive of Sprint  who was a mentor of Mr. Legere’s at AT&T. “The first time I saw John after he was named C.E.O. of T-Mobile  he was there in his suit.” That soon changed. In 2013  Mr. Legere was onstage at an event in Las Vegas with Joe Torre  the former manager of the Yankees  promoting a partnership between T-Mobile and Major League Baseball. When reporters asked him about the state of the wireless industry  he responded with a tirade about how badly customers were mistreated  and what he planned to do differently. None Soon  Mr. Legere  now 59  had a whole new look. He grew his hair to his shoulders. He wore company T-shirts wherever he went. He pulled on custom pink Converse sneakers emblazoned with the T-Mobile logo. Before long  the finance guy looked more like an aging rock star. None And on Twitter  he began hurling insults at competitors and tangling with rival C.E.O.s — including Sprint’s Marcelo Claure. None Offline  Mr. Legere also cultivated an eccentric image. He is a regular visitor to T-Mobile stores and call centers  where he delivers boisterous pep talks. At company meetings  he offers employees $100 if they will ask him a question in the form of a song. And in the office  he is fond of riding around on a Segway. “John has built a franchise around T-Mobile  which is in part his own ” said Stephen Scherr  head of the consumer and commercial banking division at Goldman Sachs  who has worked with Mr. Legere for more than a decade. But Mr. Legere has paired showmanship with results. During his tenure  T-Mobile has added subscribers and increased revenues and profits. “He’s also a great operator ” Mr. Scherr said. “He runs a really good business.” If Mr. Legere succeeds in finally joining T-Mobile and Sprint  the man who wanted to come off as the consummate outsider will have pulled off the ultimate insider move: a mega-merger to combine two rival companies and seize a greater share of a changing industry. None Under President Trump  antitrust enforcement has become unpredictable. The Justice Department has mounted a court fight against the proposed combination of AT&T and Time Warner  which do not directly compete with each other. At the same time  there appears to be little resistance to the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets by Disney  a deal which would reduce competition in the film and television industry. Mr. Legere  who is sensitive to public perceptions  seems to have anticipated this moment. In January 2017  after Mr. Trump’s election but before his inauguration  Mr. Legere was asked about his view of the regulatory environment under the Trump administration. “It’s hard not to be excited ’’ he said  about regulatory views that would be “conducive to us significantly expanding our business.” None Mr. Legere knew from firsthand experience. In 2015  after Mr. Trump insulted the U.F.C. fighter Ronda Rousey on Twitter  Mr. Legere came to her defense. In the ensuing exchange  Mr. Legere said Mr. Trump wasn’t presidential material. “I am an undecided Republican ” Mr. Legere wrote. “Well not totally undecided  I know what I don’t want :)” But it seems that the prospect of a multibillion-dollar deal can heal old wounds. Mr. Legere has since deleted that tweet about the president. And on Sunday  Mr. Legere was making the rounds with Mr. Claure of Sprint  another old social media sparring partner  to talk up their alliance.

business, How Nasdaq C.E.O. Adena Friedman Beat the Odds on Wall Street Advertisement Supported by corner office She grew up hanging around the trading floor with her father. Now she’s running a major stock exchange. How? She spoke up  and she got stuff done.  None It can be notoriously difficult for women to thrive on Wall Street. Adena Friedman says that hasn’t been the case for her.  None Today  Ms. Friedman is trying to make Nasdaq’s culture more collaborative  grapple with cryptocurrencies and create opportunities for more women to succeed in finance. She’s also overseeing Nasdaq’s continuing transformation from a stock exchange to a multifaceted company that provides technology to other exchanges around the world.  This interview  which was condensed and edited for clarity  was conducted at Nasdaq’s MarketSite location in Times Square. Tell me about your parents.  My father spent his entire career at T. Rowe Price and became the chief investment officer. I would go hang out down at the trading desk and draw on the walls.  My parents got married when they were still in college  so my mother did not graduate right away. She had kids  but then went back to college at Johns Hopkins. Then when I was 9  she decided to go to law school  and actually became the first woman partner in her law firm. So I got to see her really transform from being this awesome stay-at-home mom to being a combination of a great mom and a great career person  and my dad was really  really supportive of what she was doing. It was a formative thing for me  to see how she transformed herself. None It was a really important part of me growing up  being in an environment where being smart was celebrated. They constantly talked about going as far as you can go in your life.  I wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up  and our science teacher — who was a man — said: “O.K.  well  let’s work that out. Here are some things you can think about in terms of learning physics. Look at this great space camp you can go to.” It was not at all like  “Oh  that’s hard.” It was more like  “Great  let’s get you well positioned to be able to do that.” Did you always want to get into finance? I really wanted to do political science. I worked on a congressional campaign one summer and then worked on Capitol Hill for a summer. It was somewhat of a disillusioning experience realizing how policy really gets made. You kind of walk in with this idealistic view of “Of course your congressman’s going to represent all of your interests.” I came away saying  “Wow  progress is slow.” What drew you to Wall Street? In business school I really liked product management. As a product manager  you have to own the four P’s of marketing — product  placement  pricing and promotion. If you own the product  it’s like being the C.E.O. of your own little company. I didn’t think that I would be that excited to do that for consumer goods  but I would love to be able to do that for financial products. So I went to Nasdaq. You joined Nasdaq in 1993. What was it like being a woman on Wall Street back then?  There were not a lot of women in the office. But the man I worked for saw me as someone who was an M.B.A. grad. He would give me something to do  and I would go do it  and I would do it well. He never once made me feel at all different or disadvantaged by being a woman. I just got stuff done. When I got my first promotion I was actually pregnant. For him it was like: “Oh  that’s fine. You’ll be gone for three months  and you’ll come back.” He really just didn’t even factor it into his decision making. What advice do you give to women who feel like they aren’t receiving equal treatment? First of all  make sure you have a voice. I had this one woman that worked for me  and every time she had an idea she would whisper it into the room. So I took her aside  and I said: “Speak up. You are really  really smart. No more mousy voice. Get in the room and speak at the same tone as everyone else  and I can assure you your voice will be heard.” Next time she had an opinion  she spoke up  and everyone was like  “Wow  that’s a really good idea.” Then she was empowered to do it again and again.  And still  some women may face discrimination. What then?  If you really don’t feel you’re getting the opportunities that you should be getting  maybe you should look for a different place to work or a different person to work for. Then  of course  if you really feel like you’re not being treated properly  as a person  there should be many means for women to be able to voice that concern  to H.R.  to legal. When you rejoined Nasdaq after a stint at the Carlyle Group  you went from being a C.F.O. to being the C.E.O. Was that a difficult transition?  The C.F.O. role is actually the hardest role in the company. One minute you’re having to manage risk  and the next minute you’re having to advise your C.E.O. on how to take risk. What I found frustrating about the C.F.O. role is you’re not the ultimate decision maker. I prefer to be the risk taker. Most people know Nasdaq as the stock exchange where Facebook and Tesla trade  but that’s a small part of the business. What is Nasdaq today?  We are a great capital market ourselves. But we also provide technology to 96 other markets around the world. We are kind of the technology that powers the capital markets around the world today. Are you going to allow initial coin offerings on Nasdaq? You have to look at the blockchain and cryptocurrencies as two distinct concepts  two totally different things. The blockchain  as a technology  has the opportunity to create a lot more efficiency in the capital markets. You can create a perfect record of ownership and the transfer of ownership.  I think that the S.E.C. is taking the right actions to scrutinize in great detail the concept of an I.C.O. I.C.O.s as constructed today  outside the construct of a regulatory framework — that’s not something we’re getting involved in.  What’s your leadership style?  We have this process we call the light bulb versus the mandate. When we’re in a room and we want ideas to flow  including my crazy ideas sometimes  we say  “O.K.  let’s have some light bulbs.” It’s just an idea  could be a really bad one  but let’s put it on the table  let’s talk about it. But once we make a decision  or if there’s something that I really need the guys to just go do  I just say  “Guys  this is a mandate.” None We’ve had a couple of situations  even really recently  where we hadn’t brought any women into the interview process  and suddenly we did and were like  “Whoa  she is probably the best candidate for the job.” So it actually really does make a difference. None How has Wall Street changed for women in the past 10 or 15 years? Do you see a difference between now and then? I’ve had three very important sponsors of my career  all men. And it’s not like they sat there and had to do a lot to push  push  push me forward. They offered advice when I asked for it  and they gave me opportunity when they saw it  and that’s all they had to do. My career has been frankly an exemplary example of how women can succeed in Wall Street.

business,UK Biotech Firm Autolus Joins CAR-T Rush With Nasdaq IPO Filing Advertisement Supported by None LONDON — Autolus Therapeutics  a small British company developing cell therapy treatments  is to join the swelling ranks of listed biotech companies using the new anti-cancer technology with a planned IPO on Nasdaq. The group said on Tuesday it had filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering (IPO) under the ticker symbol AUTL. The number of its American depositary shares to be sold in the IPO and the pricing terms have not yet been determined. Autolus is developing chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) treatments to fight blood cancers and  hopefully  also solid tumours. The first two CAR-T treatments from Novartis and Gilead Sciences won U.S. approval last year for rare blood cancer and a number of start-up companies  as well as large drugmakers  are investing heavily in the space. Autolus  which was spun out from University College London in 2014 and uses cell technology pioneered by Dr. Martin Pule  is aiming to develop next-generation CAR-T treatments that it hopes will have an edge over the first wave of therapies. Its backers include Syncona  Woodford Investment Management and Arix Bioscience.

business,Nasdaq Hits 6 000 as Markets Rise on Tax Overhaul Optimism Advertisement Supported by None Propelled by the skyrocketing returns of large technology stocks  the Nasdaq composite index pushed past the 6 000 level for the first time in its history. The sharp move was driven by a confluence of positive news developments  including a market-friendly outcome in the first round of France’s presidential election over the weekend and reports that President Trump will put forward a plan to slash corporate taxes to 15 percent. None But it has been the technology-laden index of 100 Nasdaq stocks that has delivered the far superior performance  rising 14 percent this year — more than twice the gains of the Dow and S.&P. 500. For the day  the Nasdaq closed at 6 025.49  up 0.7 percent for the day. Driving this performance has been the persistent run-up in stocks such as Apple  Facebook  Google and Amazon  which together now comprise about a third of the index  as measured by QQQ  the $43 billion exchange traded fund that tracks Nasdaq stocks. Apple  Amazon and Facebook are up over 20 percent for the year  with Google having increased by 12 percent. The Dow closed at 20 996.12  up 232.23 points  or 1.12 percent  while the broader S.&P. 500 ended at 2 388.61  up 14.46 points  or 0.61 percent. None Analysts have pointed out  though  that compared with past manias — in particular the dot-com bubble — the recent surge in technology stocks stands on firmer ground. “In 2000  the price-to-earnings ratio for Nasdaq was 170 — today it is trading at 26 times ” said Charlie Bilello  the director of research at Pension Partners  an investment advisory firm  referring to a common gauge for measuring stock valuations. “That is not cheap  but it’s not crazy. We are definitely not at the level where the average guy quits his job to trade stocks.” That may be true  but there is no doubt that the explosion in size of these stocks has taken many market participants by surprise  even if it is accepted that their corporate fundamentals are superior. None None Indeed  the booming returns of these index-heavy stocks has been a cause of intense frustration for portfolio managers and hedge funds who charge their investors steep fees to uncover hidden gems in the stock market. That is because unless they have a large part of their portfolio in fast growing (and richly valued) stocks like Amazon  Facebook and Apple  they are going to lag their benchmarks and lose money to cheaper exchange traded funds that track these indexes and provide maximum exposure to these stocks. None “The mega cap growth stocks in Nasdaq have had a strong start to 2017  and many active managers have been underweight ” said Todd Rosenbluth  an exchange traded fund specialist at CFRA Research. “People underestimate the fact that large companies continue to get larger. And the answer is — yes they can.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/business/dealbook/stock-market-trump-taxes.html
business,Technology Companies Drag Stock Markets Down Again Advertisement Supported by None Technology stocks helped propel the nine-year bull market. Optimistic investors piled into the shares  hoping to grab a piece of the profits from industries such as social media  autonomous driving  video streaming and artificial intelligence. Now  that confidence is evaporating. Investors pummeled technology company stocks again on Tuesday  knocking the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index down 1.7 percent. The Nasdaq composite  laden with technology stocks  sank 2.9 percent after a flurry of bad news about specific companies metastasized into a broad retreat from technology stocks. None The news sent Nvidia shares plunging 7.8 percent  the sharpest decline of any company in the S.&P. None The investigation adds to the financial pressure Tesla is already facing  as it burns through cash and struggles to accelerate production of its Model 3 electric vehicles. Citing those challenges  Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating on the company’s bonds after markets closed Tuesday. Across the technology industry  investors are suddenly anxious that intensified regulatory scrutiny is going to hurt profits and therefore stock prices. That spells trouble for the markets because tech companies have long been investor favorites. Facebook  Amazon  Netflix and Google’s parent company  Alphabet  have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years. Those days are gone. None Most of the major technology companies were big losers Tuesday. Netflix fell 6.1 percent  its sharpest decline since July 2016. Alphabet and Microsoft both dropped 4.6 percent. The hammering of technology stocks is only the most recent source of market turbulence. Since February  a diverse crop of worries — such as the prospects of central banks raising interest rates quickly and concerns of a trade war derailing the economy — have unnerved investors. After years of being placid  markets have been on a roller coaster  routinely rising or falling by more than 1 percent in a single day. Because technology stocks until recently had been on such a tear  their recent stumbles are all the more painful for the broader markets. Since the start of the bull market in March 2009  the price of tech shares has soared more than 460 percent. The overall S.&P. index  by contrast  has gained 290 percent. The S.&P. and other indexes are weighted by the market values of their constituent companies. In 2009  the tech sector made up 17.5 percent of the S.&P. 500. Today  that figure is more than 25 percent. As a result  the recent declines in the values of tech stocks have dragged the overall indexes down with them.

Her predecessor  Robert Greifeld  will become chairman of the company’s board  replacing Borje Ekholm. For Ms. Friedman  47  the promotion comes at a time of consolidation within the world of market operators and of rapid changeover in technology. Under Mr. Greifeld  Nasdaq expanded from a single stock exchange to a global markets operator that now trades stocks and options  including through acquisitions of counterparts  like OMX of Sweden  in the United States and abroad. None In an interview  Ms. Friedman said that her job as chief executive would be to keep Nasdaq on top of the shifting landscape. “Nasdaq today is a world-class market operator and technology leader ” she said. Since joining Nasdaq in 1993  Ms. Friedman has rose steadily through the company  she has served as the head of data products and as chief financial officer. Her career took a different path in 2011 when she joined the investment firm Carlyle Group as its chief financial officer  ahead of its initial public offering — on the Nasdaq market. Ms. Friedman rejoined Nasdaq two years ago as president and heir apparent to Mr. Greifeld. She added the title of chief operating officer in December. The timing of her promotion was not a surprise to analysts: Mr. Greifeld’s contract was set to expire in February  and the market operator’s board had long been working on a succession plan. “I’ve had the opportunity to watch Adena grow and develop over the last 14 years  and can confidently say she is the right person for this role and is unquestionably as passionate about the company’s future as I am ” Mr. Greifeld said in a statement. “Adena has played an instrumental role in building this organization into one of the most innovative leaders  with a tremendous disruptive spirit. I know she will do exceptionally well for clients  shareholders and employees.” Ms. Friedman will also become one of the highest-ranking women executives in the finance world. “I have been measured on my merit and on my accomplishments ” she said  adding that she hoped other women would see Wall Street as becoming more inclusive.

business,"European Stocks Take a Breather After Strong Rally Advertisement Supported by None LONDON — European stock markets eased slightly Friday after a strong rally saw many indexes strike multi-week highs. Wall Street was poised for further solid gains at the open despite ongoing geopolitical unease related to President Donald Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. KEEPING SCORE: In Europe  France's CAC 40 was down 0.3 percent at 5 520 while Germany's DAX also fell 0.3 percent to 12 986.

STOCKS IN VOGUE: Stocks around the world have been in demand this past week  partly because general risk appetite has improved in spite of Trump's move on Iran. That suggests that investors are fairly positive on the outlook for stocks  certainly a contrast to earlier in the year. Soft U.S. inflation data have helped  reining in expectations of aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. U.S. consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in April  indicating that that broader inflation pressure in the world's No. 1 economy remains muted. High oil prices have also helped boost the share prices of oil companies. ANALYST TAKE: ""It is worth noting that global equity markets remain highly sensitive to geopolitics and speculation of higher interest rates "" said Lukman Otunuga  research analyst at FXTM. ""Risks in the form of escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and other forms of uncertainties could still create headwinds for the markets at any time.""

The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended 0.1 percent higher after spending most of the day in negative territory. Italy's FTSE MIB closed 1.6 percent lower amid worries about political turmoil in the euro zone's third-largest economy. Italian banks took the most off the index  losing 2.1 percent. State-controlled oil major Eni was down 2.6 percent.  ""It's not a good day for Italian assets. Markets are starting to feel the pressure of elections "" said Carlo Franchini  head of institutional clients at Italy's Banca Ifigest.  President Sergio Mattarella called on Monday for Italy's bickering parties to rally behind a ""neutral government."" Italy's two largest parties  the far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement  opposed that idea  raising the likelihood of an immediate return to the polls. The Italian stock market has outperformed its European peers this year  but a number of analysts warned that political risk was not priced into the market. On Monday  the FTSE MIB ended at its highest since October 2009. Elsewhere in Europe  first-quarter corporate earnings and mergers and acquisitions prompted sharp individual price moves while investors prepared for Donald Trump's decision on whether to withdraw the U.S. from the Iran nuclear agreement.  The announcement is expected after the market close and could disrupt global oil supplies. The price of crude is near its highest in more than three years.  Shares in Danish hearing aid maker William Demant were the worst performers of the STOXX  falling 9.5 percent after warning that lower demand would weigh on sales.

business,"Currency Relief Drives German Stocks Upgrade at Kepler Advertisement Supported by None MILAN — Kepler Cheuvreux upgraded German stocks to neutral on Wednesday  saying the drop in the euro <EUR=> that has already helped European equities outperform recently could bolster earnings expectations.  ""Currency depreciation is already arresting the under-performance of the region's universe of blue chips most dependent upon external markets "" said Christopher Potts  head of economics and strategy at the European bank. ""We think that it is judicious to remove our underweight position in the German market  at least temporarily  since profit estimates for this market’s large caps should derive benefit from currency relief into the summer "" he wrote in a note. To compensate for the German upgrade  Kepler downgraded Danish equities to neutral. The recent recovery in the dollar has already raised hopes that currency turbulence for European corporates will now subside  after first-quarter earnings from companies such as Bayer  Solvay or Sanofi took a hit from the stronger euro. The euro slid to a new 2018 low on Wednesday before recovering slightly  as investors bet on dollar strength due to relatively higher interest rates.

business,"Buffett Bashes Bitcoin as Thriving on Mystique  Favors Stocks Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Monday said buyers of bitcoin  which he has characterized as ""rat poison squared "" thrive on the hope they'll find other people who will pay more for it. Likening bitcoin demand to the tulip bulb mania in 17th century Holland  Buffett  the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc  said the mystique behind the cryptocurrency has caused its price to surge. ""If you don't understand it  you get much more excited "" Buffett said on CNBC television. ""People like to speculate  they like to gamble."" He said investors now are much better off owning U.S. stocks  whose prices are elevated but not in a ""bubble "" and it would take a ""nanosecond"" for him to choose stocks over 10- or 30-year U.S. government bonds now yielding around 3 percent. Charlie Munger  Buffett's longtime business partner and a Berkshire vice chairman  is also no bitcoin fan  describing it as ""worthless artificial gold."" He likened it to Oscar Wilde's definition of fox hunting  calling it ""the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable."" Buffett  87  and Munger  94  spoke two days after they presided at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha  Nebraska  which was expected to have drawn more than 40 000 people. It was the first meeting since Berkshire elevated longtime executives Greg Abel and Ajit Jain to vice chairmen  making them top contenders to replace Buffett as chief executive. Buffett said their promotions have been ""very  very good"" for the company. Berkshire has said its board knows who would become chief executive if the need arose. One of its members  Microsoft Corp co-founder Bill Gates  said on CNBC ""it's not a horse race"" between Abel and Jain. Buffett renewed his desire to spend some of Berkshire’s low-yielding cash on a major acquisition. He said he would be happier if Berkshire had $30 billion of cash and equivalents  not the $108.6 billion it reported holding at the end of March. ""If a $100 billion deal came along that Charlie and I really liked  we’d get it done "" he said. Buffett revealed last week Berkshire had bought about 75 million additional Apple Inc shares in the first quarter  adding to the 165.3 million it already owns. It now has a 5 percent stake in the iPhone maker  trailing only Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. Buffett said he would be happy to see the Apple share price fall if it would spur repurchases.  Munger  meanwhile  said Berkshire may have been ""a little too restrained"" in buying Apple  saying ""it's reasonably priced and strong."" He added: ""I wished we owned more of it.""  Buffett also said the list of CEO candidates has been ""narrowed down"" for the healthcare venture between Berkshire  Amazon.com and JPMorgan Chase. He said choosing the CEO will be ""by far the most difficult decision we will make.""

business,"Stocks Jump  With Buffett Helping Apple to New Highs Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — U.S. stocks made up for a shaky week with a strong finish Friday as Apple led a rally in technology companies. The tech giant hit an all-time high after Warren Buffett said he'd made another big investment. Stocks got off to a mixed start after trade talks between the U.S. and China ended with few signs of progress. The April jobs report showed that hiring continued at a solid clip and wages continued to grow at a slow pace. Apple surged after Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway bought 75 million shares during the first quarter. Alphabet  Cisco Systems and other technology companies rose  and retailers  banks  and household goods makers also rallied. Investors also cheered strong first-quarter results from companies including Shake Shack and Activision Blizzard. ""We went into this earnings season with very high expectations "" said Quincy Krosby  chief markets strategist for Prudential Financial. ""When you go in with such high expectations  you expect near perfection."" The S&P 500 index climbed 33.69 points  or 1.3 percent  to 2 663.42. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 332.36 points  or 1.4 percent  to 24 262.51. The Nasdaq composite jumped 121.47 points  or 1.7 percent  to 7 209.62. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks gained 19.05 points  or 1.2 percent  to 1 565.60. Overall  stocks have taken small losses in choppy trading over the last two weeks. But for Apple  this was the best week in six and a half years. Apple rose 3.9 percent to $183.83 after Warren Buffett told CNBC his company boosted its investment in Apple to more than 240 million shares altogether. Buffett told CNBC about the purchase ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting this weekend. Berkshire stock rose 2.1 percent to $195.64. Apple climbed 13.3 percent for the week after it reported solid quarterly results and investors were pleased with its forecast of solid iPhone sales  which came as a relief. It also raised its dividend and announced a big stock repurchase. Companies have done well in the first quarter  but stocks haven't necessarily followed suit as investors worried about the U.S.-China trade spat  rising interest rates  and other issues. But on Friday investors responded. After better-than-expected reports  burger chain Shake Shack surged 18 percent to $55.95 while music streaming company Pandora Media advanced 19.8 percent to $6.89. Video game maker Activision Blizzard gained 4.5 percent to $69.84. The stock had dipped Thursday afternoon after Activision's results were released early. U.S. employers stepped up hiring modestly in April  and the hiring estimate from March was revised higher. That's evident the economy remains resilient even though some businesses are concerned about a possible trade war. While many employers say it's difficult to find qualified workers  they have yet to significantly boost pay in most industries  a trend that continued last month. ""That may not be good for Main Street  but it's what Wall Street wanted to see "" said Krosby  of Prudential. The Trump administration asked China to reduce its trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion by the end of 2020  striking an assertive stance in talks aimed at averting a trade war between the world's largest economies. It also wants China to immediately stop providing subsidies to certain industries listed in a key industrial plan and end some of its policies related to technology transfers  a key source of tension underlying the dispute. While the trade tensions have rattled investors  many market watchers think the two sides will eventually come to a deal that doesn't disrupt trade much. Engineering and construction company Fluor plunged after it slashed its profit forecast because a gas-fired power project suffered ""continued challenges."" The company took an unexpected loss in the first quarter and now expects a profit of $2.10 to $2.50 per share for the year  down from 2$3.10 to $3.50 per share. The stock dropped 22.4 percent to $45.76. Bond prices rose early  but later gave up that gain. The yield on the 2-year Treasury note rose to 2.49 percent from 2.48 percent. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.95 percent. That helped banks recover from an early loss. Lower bond yields mean lower rates for mortgages and other types of loans  which reduces profits for banks. Companies that pay big dividends didn't rise as much as the rest of the market. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 1.9 percent to $69.72 per barrel in New York. Brent crude  the international standard  gained 1.7 percent to $74.87 per barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline jumped 1.3 percent to $2.11 a gallon. Heating oil climbed 2 percent to $2.15 a gallon. Natural gas lost 0.6 percent to $2.71 per 1 000 cubic feet. Gold gained 0.2 percent to $1 314.70 an ounce. Silver added 0.4 percent to $16.52 an ounce. Copper rose 0.2 percent to $3.09 a pound. The dollar fell to 109.11 yen from 109.73 yen. The euro fell to $1.1962 from $1.1993. Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.9 percent and the DAX in Germany added 1 percent. France's CAC 40 gained 0.3 percent.

business,"Stocks Close Lower  as Telecom Companies Weigh on Market Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — U.S. stocks fell moderately on Monday  giving up an early gain  but still ended April higher. It was the first monthly increase for the market since January as company earnings have come in better than many expected. Indexes jumped in the early going following news of several buyout deals and more strong earnings reports  but sagged after lunchtime  weighed down by losses for telecom stocks and other areas of the market. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 148.04 points  or 0.6 percent  to 24 163.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 21.86 points  or 0.8 percent  to 2 648.05 and the Nasdaq composite lost 53.53 points  or 0.8 percent  to 7 066.27. Dow member McDonald's jumped 5.8 percent to $167.83 after it reported healthier profit and revenue than analysts expected for the first three months of the year. Sales at its restaurants open more than a year were much stronger than Wall Street had forecast McDonald's joined the wave of companies to report big earnings growth for the first quarter  which has been better than analysts expected. Just over half the companies in the S&P 500 have reported their earnings for the first three months of the year  and they're on pace to deliver overall growth of 23 percent  according to FactSet. That would be the strongest showing since the summer of 2010. ""It's been phenomenal "" said Phil Orlando  chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors. ""Corporate earnings are doing better. Economic growth is doing better  and I think the market is begrudgingly allowing those numbers to work their way into share prices."" The S&P 500 has been whipping higher and lower in recent months  hurt by worries about higher interest rates and the possibility of a trade war. But the index is ending April up a modest 0.3 percent  compared to the 2.7 percent loss it had in March and 3.9 percent loss it had in February. At the center of the buyout news was Sprint and T-Mobile. The pair announced a $26.5 billion deal to merge following years of consideration for a combination. Investors are unsure whether this attempt will get the necessary approvals from U.S. regulators. Sprint dropped 13.7 percent to $5.61  and T-Mobile lost 6.2 percent to $60.51. Other telecom stocks also fell  with Verizon giving up 4.3 percent to $49.35 and AT&T falling 1 percent to $32.70. Oil company Andeavor was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 after Marathon Petroleum said it will buy the refiner and pipeline owner for more than $23 billion. Andeavor  which used to be called Tesoro  soared 13 percent to $138.32. And DCT Industrial Trust  a logistics real-estate company  gained 11.6 percent to $65.57 after Prologis  an owner of distribution centers and other logistics real estate  agreed on Sunday to buy it in an all-stock deal. Besides being the heart of earnings reporting season for companies  this week will also feature a policy meeting for the Federal Reserve on interest rates. The Fed will announce its decision on Wednesday. On Friday  the government releases its jobs report  which is usually the most anticipated economic report of each month. Benchmark U.S. crude rose 47 cents to $68.57 per barrel. Brent crude  the international standard  gained 53 cents to $75.17. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dipped to 2.94 percent from 2.96 percent late Friday. The dollar rose to 109.29 Japanese yen from 109.02 yen late Friday. The euro fell to $1.2082 from $1.2121  and the British pound dipped to $1.3748 from $1.3785. Gold fell $4.20 to $1 319.20 an ounce  silver fell 10 cents to $16.40 an ounce and copper rose less than 1 cent to $3.074 a pound.

business,Finding Emerging Markets Stocks With Social Consciences Advertisement Supported by None Until recently  investors interested in emerging market funds had few ways of singling out companies with standout environmental  social and governance records. That has begun to change over the last several years  as the popularity of investing with an eye to these issues has surged. There are now 10 mutual funds and exchange-traded-funds that invest in stocks in emerging markets while making environmental  social and governance performance an explicit part of their mission  according to Morningstar. None For its first several years  the E.S.G. index outperformed its peer benchmark. Mr. Varco wanted to determine whether that was luck. He crunched the data and concluded that selecting companies based on nonfinancial factors had helped. Simply put  the E.S.G. index did better because the companies within it appeared  on average  to be better run. “There’s yet to be a year where the standard index did better ” he said. None People who opt for funds of this sort should understand that their performance will diverge from that of well-known emerging-markets benchmarks  said Todd L. Rosenbluth  director of E.T.F. and mutual fund research at CFRA  an investment research firm. “Because the holdings and the weightings differ  the performance is likely to differ ” he said. “E.S.G. strategies tend to have hefty weightings in technology stocks. So when tech is in favor  as it was in 2017  that will help them. If we hit a time when energy or old-line industrials shine  they won’t perform as well.” None None None Over the last five years  emerging markets have chugged upward  with MSCI’s conventional index gaining an annualized average of 4.99 percent. In the first quarter  the index gained 1.42 percent. MSCI’s Emerging Markets E.S.G. Leaders Index has outpaced its peer — rising an annualized average of 8.6 percent over the last five years  though only 1.01 percent in the first quarter. When Mr. Varco  of Cambridge Associates  did his study  he didn’t dig into precisely why companies in the E.S.G. index might excel or  conversely  why ones in the conventional index might lag. But he said one reason might be that state-owned enterprises  like Brazil’s Petrobras  where a prominent bribery scandal has implicated dozens of government officials  loom large in the standard index. These outfits are often not run as well as their nonstate kin  he said. Managers of actively managed funds echoed his assessment. None None “The Chinese state doesn’t work for you ” he said. “It works for itself. Its goals and incentives aren’t aligned with those of minority shareholders.” Two Chinese state-owned enterprises — China Mobile and China Construction Bank — are among the top 10 constituents of the standard index. Put differently  the problem with state-run companies  besides potential political agendas  is governance. They don’t have procedures in place  as developed-world public companies typically do  to ensure that minority investors are treated fairly and have access to all the information they need about company operations  investments and finances. None “For me  the emphasis is sustainability ” he said. “Companies that plan for the future  with adequate infrastructure and R.&D.  and look to build long-term relationships with all their stakeholders  I believe they’ll ultimately have higher returns.” None The case for investing in the emerging world can be boiled down to a word: growth. Compared with developed countries  emerging ones are  on average  growing faster  and they are pulling hundreds of millions of people into the middle class for the first time. That’s giving rise to new companies and creating huge new markets for existing ones  said Binu George  portfolio strategist for the emerging markets team at GMO  an asset management firm. “There are 24 emerging-market countries ” he said. “In those countries and their stocks  there’s a massive opportunity for you to make money.” With that faster growth comes greater risk: On average  the returns of emerging markets stocks roller coaster more than those of developed market ones. “The asset class is incredibly volatile  and yet there are still many great businesses in the emerging world ” said Mr. Eidelman of the JPMorgan fund. Over time  patience — and attention to environmental  social and governance factors — can pay off  leading to superior performance  he said. “The time frame really matters. If you’re looking to own a business for a long time — not just trade a stock — then factors around how that business interacts with all of its stakeholders become much more important. If you’re just trading monthly  the fact that you think the management is dodgy might not matter.” For someone committed to so-called socially responsible investing  including a relatively small allocation — say 5 or 10 percent of a diversified portfolio — to this niche can make sense  added Mr. Rosenbluth of CFRA. “E.S.G. factors are perhaps even more relevant outside the U.S.  especially governance ” he said. “This sounds obvious  but in less developed countries  the companies have less developed governance. By investing in ones that are providing better governance  you’re encouraging other companies to act more responsibly.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/business/finding-emerging-markets-stocks-with-social-consciences.html
business,"European Shares Weighed by BT  Utilities  Italy Stocks Slide Advertisement Supported by None MILAN — European shares pulled lower on Thursday  weighed down by losses in BT following a disappointing update and weakness among utilities stocks  while political jitters hit Italian stocks. The banking sector was a bright spot  however  with gains in RBS following a multi-billion dollar deal to settle a U.S. investigation of the bank's bond sales  and a solid update from Italy's biggest bank UniCredit helping limit losses on the pan-European STOXX 600  which ended just 0.1 percent lower. BT shares fell more than 7 percent after saying it was cutting 13 000 jobs  the latest attempt by Britain's biggest telecoms group to rebuild after an accounting scandal and a downturn in trading. Traders said its latest update showed a disappointing guidance  while Jefferies analysts highlighted that the company missed out on the opportunity of announcing a bolder move of fibre roll out  while job cuts were bigger then expected. ""No evidence of inflection in results or mindset "" said Jefferies. RBS rallied 3.8 percent after it agreed to pay a smaller-than-expected $4.9 billion to resolve a U.S. investigation into its sale of mortgage-backed securities. Analysts  who had estimated the U.S. could impose a fine of up to $12 billion  said the bank could reinstate a dividend. Gains in RBS helped the UK's FTSE rise 0.5 percent  outperforming other European bourses after the Bank of England's decision to keep rates on hold sparked a drop in sterling. Still in banks  UniCredit rose 1.8 percent after it posted its best first-quarter result since 2007  topping forecasts with a 1.1 billion euro net profit thanks to lower-than-expected loan losses.  Italy's FTSE MIB fell 1 percent as bond yields jumped on an increased possibility that a government of anti-establishment parties will take power.  Some of the biggest movers on the STOXX also included precious metals miner Randgold  down 7 percent after its quarterly profit fell  while Next rose more than 6 percent after a strong outlook and trading update. Utilities were a weak spot  down 0.9 percent to lead sectoral losers in Europe  weighed by a disappointing update at Italy's Enel.  Oil stocks took a breather after hitting their highest level in more than 3-1/2 years in the previous session after the price of oil jumped on the back of the U.S. quitting a nuclear deal with Iran. The sector ended the day 0.9 percent lower.

business,North Korea’s Phony Peace Ploy Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Eberstadt is a founding director of the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. None None None None None None None And so the North  rather than committing to a legally binding (and potentially destabilizing) peace treaty  is likely to do again what it has gotten away with in previous meetings with the South: dangle aspirational goals in jointly signed  but totally unenforceable  official statements. None None Not to put too fine a point on it: All of these deals were then trash-canned. The North Korean promises in them were worthless  indeed deceitful. These agreements only seemed to hold force until  well  they no longer did  when Pyongyang unilaterally decided to ignore  violate or repudiate them. None None Why  given the precedents? Because the Sunshine Policy is something of a secular religion in South Korea — at least among its adherents  who include main players in the current government — and  like all faiths  it is immune to empirical falsification. Sunshiners also seem to be convinced that only they can coax the North onto the path of common sense. And let’s not underestimate the political psychopathology of appeasement: People grow weary of the prospect of endless conflict with an implacable enemy and want to believe in solutions even if there are none. (Western Europe suffered a similar condition regarding the Soviet Union in the 1970s and ’80s.) The problem is that North Korea can walk away from its peace promises at any time. And when it eventually does  it will be able to blame whomever it wishes for this tragic result — potentially polarizing politics in South Korea  igniting tensions in Seoul’s alliance with Washington or fracturing the loose coalition of governments that rallied around sanctions against it. In the meantime  Pyongyang will hold the other parties hostage to the fear that if any of its new demands aren’t met  it will quit the peace process. None South Korean officials say that any permanent peace deal will be conditioned on the North’s denuclearization and that the North has agreed to that term. Only  the two governments do not agree on what “denuclearization” means. The South  and its allies  have in mind a complete  irreversible and verifiable process under which the North would forgo all of its nuclear weapons. The North tends to talk instead of the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ” which starts with cutting the South’s ties with its nuclear ally  the United States. And when it comes to denuclearization at home  Pyongyang frames the matter as an arms-control question: If America reduces its arsenal  so will we. Maybe. North Korea is a fearsome adversary. Let’s not play pretend-diplomacy with it. Nicholas Eberstadt is a political economist at the American Enterprise Institute.

business,The Market Collapse Blame Game Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None According to an old proverb  success has many fathers  but failure is an orphan. That proved to be all too true of the 2008-09 Great Recession: In the aftermath  nobody in the policymaking  financial or academic communities stepped forward to accept responsibility for the worst global economic setback in the past 70 years. It’s unlikely anyone will take credit for the current global market free fall  which  after three days  is clearly not just a correction but an overdue unwinding of years of excess. Whether the damage remains limited to markets or spills over into the general economy remains to be seen  but we could well be on the verge of another global financial crisis. This despite the fact that the outgoing Federal Reserve chairwoman  Janet Yellen  repeatedly reassured us that we would not see another global economic crisis in her lifetime  while the academic economic community again distinguished itself by its virtual silence as bubbles formed in the market over the past few years. And just last month in Davos  Switzerland  President Trump boasted again that his administration’s policies were leading to the stock market shattering records on a routine basis  while the bankers kept making risky loans as the music played on. It’s no surprise that sooner or later  the global financial markets would unwind as violently as they now seem to be doing  considering how far they were allowed to get out of line with their underlying values. It was only a matter of time before a market bust was going to occur. It was not simply that nothing was done to stop global stock market valuations from reaching levels seen only three times in the past hundred years. It was also that government bond yields were allowed to drop to historically low levels  and nothing was done to stop financial institutions from making very risky loans at unusually low interest rates. One can perhaps partly excuse the world’s major central banks  including the Federal Reserve under Ms. Yellen’s predecessor  Ben Bernanke  for having set in motion our present boom-bust cycle by their policy response to the Great Recession. Major economies relied too heavily on monetary policy to get past it  while refusing to deploy adequate and well-targeted budget stimulus measures. With the economy then in danger of succumbing to a deflationary spiral and with interest rates having gone as low as possible  the world’s central banks had little option but to buy government bonds on an enormous scale to encourage investors to take on additional risk. At the time  that seemed a price worth paying  even though it came at the risk of distorting financial market prices and creating a global market bubble. Less easy to excuse was the Fed’s failure last year to remove the low-interest-rate punch bowl when the global economic party was showing clear signs of getting out of hand. With the American economy having reached close to full employment  and with a 25 percent jump in equity prices and 10 percent depreciation in the dollar over the past year  why was the Fed so reluctant to increase rates? A more aggressive monetary policy in 2017 might have brought sense back to the market and reduced the chance that the American economy might overheat and bring inflation in its wake. It is also difficult to excuse the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress for providing us with an unfunded tax cut at precisely the wrong time in the economic cycle. With unemployment very low and the economy growing at a healthy clip  the last thing the economy needed was a fiscal stimulus that might stoke fears of inflation and bring the bond vigilantes out of the woodwork. The academics and bankers also deserve blame for having learned so little from the world’s last boom-bust cycle. Is it too much to ask of academic economists to learn that excessive asset price inflation is not consistent with long-run economic stability — and that their role should be to sound the alarm when bubbles are forming? Is it too much to ask of the financial sector to remember that making reckless loans gets us all into deep trouble when the music eventually stops? I raise all these questions not as an exercise in finger-pointing but in the hope that over the weeks ahead policymakers  economists and politicians draw the right lessons about how we got into this very difficult economic and financial market situation. Only then will there be some chance that we might escape these boom-bust cycles  which now appear to be occurring on a regular basis.

business,How to Save the Saudi Golden Goose Advertisement Supported by None Ms. Wald is the author of “Saudi  Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom’s Pursuit of Profit and Power.” For almost 40 years  Saudi Aramco has operated with a tremendous degree of independence for a national oil company. That has worked well for the company and for the country: Aramco has prospered financially and almost single-handedly funded the Saudi state and the royal family. But that could all be changing. Mohammed bin Salman  the hugely popular crown prince  is reshaping his country  and he seems intent on putting his stamp on Aramco. There are signs that the government is exerting new control over Aramco’s most fundamental decisions. This is a mistake. Too much interference could destabilize the company and  by extension  a large part of the Saudi economy. When it comes to the future of Aramco  the government in Riyadh needs to let the professionals do their jobs. Aramco is unique among national oil companies. Rather than seizing the company through nationalization  the Saudi government purchased Aramco from its American owners in transactions in the 1970s. The Saudi leadership in the 1970s insisted on a legal purchase to avoid disrupting a hugely profitable enterprise. After the purchase  the Saudi government essentially left the business to Aramco employees who were  at the time  a mix of American and Saudi managers. In less than a decade  Saudi executives took the reins. Many of them had worked their way up within Aramco starting when they were teenagers. The professional oilmen were in charge. The company was owned by Saudi Arabia  but it collected its own revenue and controlled its own finances. Ali al-Naimi  Aramco’s chief executive from 1988 to 1995  told me recently that the Saudi finance ministry tried to co-opt the company’s finances in the 1980s. “What they wanted was all the income to come to the ministry and they dole out our expenditures ” he recalled. “I said no way. The income comes to us and we give you royalty  taxes and dividends from our profits. We cannot have the income come to you directly.” The king at the time  Fahd  sided with Mr. Naimi  because he understood that Aramco’s independence was vital to the success of the venture and thus the wealth of the Saudi state  people and royal family. None None None None Therein lies the problem. The company has always made its own decisions about its next steps. It is now waiting for direction from the outside. Even the identity of this “shareholder” is unclear. Who really owns Aramco? The official company line is that it is owned by the Saudi government. But what does that mean? Mr. Naimi made sure that the finance ministry stayed far away from Aramco’s revenue  and although the oil ministry represents Saudi Arabia in OPEC  it does not determine Aramco’s strategy. None None But right now  and for the foreseeable future  Saudi Arabia still depends on Aramco for its wealth  and the monarchy depends on that wealth for its power. Without a strong  independent Aramco  power could be precarious.

business,It Oversaw For-Profit Colleges That Imploded. Now It Seeks a Comeback. Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — The organization at the center of one of the largest fraud scandals in the history of for-profit colleges is planning a comeback. None None Now  that same accrediting council is asking to be reinstated by the Trump administration as a federal gatekeeper for hundreds of degree-granting programs and billions of dollars in federal funds. The move comes as the accrediting agency continues to be the target of criticism. Last week  Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa  the outspoken chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  singled it out when he charged that for-profit accreditation boards were running “visa mills” used by foreign students to come to the United States with minimal scrutiny. Michelle Edwards  the council’s president and chief executive  said that two of the schools mentioned in Mr. Grassley’s letter had already had their recognition revoked for failing to meet financial requirements  but that the agency’s criteria do not focus on matters relating to student visas. The council’s prospective return has outraged student and consumer protection advocates  who worry that it would signal that predatory institutions will be allowed to flourish in the for-profit-friendly administration of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. None “If they reverse this decision  it will tell accreditors that you can fight back and politically try to retain your eligibility ” said Robert Shireman  a former deputy under secretary at the Education Department who is now a senior fellow at the Century Foundation  a liberal research organization. “And more important  it will tell accreditors that there are no consequences if you do a horrible job.” None Most public  private and nonprofit higher education institutions are regionally accredited  while national and specialized accreditors tend to draw for-profit and trade schools. To receive federal financial aid funding  schools must be accredited by an Education Department-recognized agency. The Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools was responsible for about 240 institutions that received $4.7 billion in taxpayer money when it came under scrutiny in 2015. For-profit accreditation has faced scrutiny dating back to the early years of the G.I. Bill  when the institutions were accused of preying on veterans who received large sums of federal education funding when they returned from war. But it had been decades since the for-profit sector felt as targeted as it did under the Obama administration  industry leaders say. And they contend that a reinstatement of the banished accrediting council could remedy the unfair treatment meted out by the previous White House. A federal judge recently ruled that the department had acted “arbitrarily and capriciously” in determining the council’s fate. “All we have ever asked for is due process and fairness ” said Steve Gunderson  a former Republican congressman who leads the trade organization Career Education Colleges and Universities. “We now hope the current secretary will recognize the need to work with A.C.I.C.S. and the schools impacted by this ruling.” The independent advisory committee that vets accrediting bodies  called the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity  will consider the council’s application in May  just a few weeks before dozens of schools serving at least 100 000 students that are still operating under its purview will lose accreditation. None None Officials at the council say it has made more than 50 improvements. “Today  as a result of these changes  we are a fundamentally different agency and  I believe  a better one ” Ms. Edwards  the council’s president  said in a statement. Consumer protection and student advocates are unconvinced. None None It accredited Corinthian Colleges even as it was declaring bankruptcy in 2015  and the agency did not pull the accreditation of ITT Technical Institute until after the federal advisory panel recommended the termination of the council’s recognition. Ms. Edwards said the organization had overhauled its governance structure to eliminate conflicts of interest. It established an ethics committee  created a group to monitor complaints and identify at-risk institutions  and strengthened data collection by requiring campuses to file quarterly and annual accountability reports. “We are ready for the scrutiny because we believe today’s A.C.I.C.S. fully meets the criteria to be recognized by the department ” she said. None “Given the gravity of A.C.I.C.S.’s recent dereliction and the magnitude of the harm A.C.I.C.S. caused to students and taxpayers  any attempt by A.C.I.C.S. to become nationally recognized once again should be treated with great skepticism by the department ” the letter read. None None The judgment did not overturn the Obama Education Department’s decision  or weigh in on whether it was justified  but sent the case to Ms. DeVos to reconsider. The judge’s action was cheered by for-profit agencies that had long complained that the Obama administration targeted the accrediting organization unfairly. “Yes  our sector has had bad schools like every sector of higher education ” Mr. Gunderson said. “But it is time that everyone across the political spectrum stop  step back and look for ways to work together to establish public policies that treat all sectors of higher education on a fair and equal basis. The ideological wars must end.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/us/politics/for-profit-colleges-accreditation.html

Portugal's largest company by assets made 166 million euros (146.5 million pounds) in January-March in net profit  while earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 12 percent to 893 million euros  it said in a statement.  Revenues from electricity sales fell 9 percent to 1.39 billion euros despite a rise in electricity output of 7 percent in the first quarter  when rains finally refilled most of its hydroelectric dams after a severe drought in 2016-17. The utility's installed capacity rose 3 percent from a year earlier. In Portugal  EDP incurred losses from a government-imposed reduction in the final compensation paid to the former monopoly for giving up some long-term power-purchase deals  an increase of clawback tax in August 2017  and higher costs of the so-called social tariff for low-income households. Without these effects  EBITDA would have risen 2 percent  the company said.  EDP said EBITDA at its Brazilian unit rose 18 percent in local currency  but fell 1 percent in euros due to a sharp depreciation of the Brazilian real. On Wednesday  EDP's wind energy subsidiary EDP Renewables posted a 39 percent rise in quarterly profit thanks to some asset sales  but its revenues remained flat.

business,"Toyota Reports Improved Quarterly Profit Despite Incentives Advertisement Supported by None TOKYO — Toyota Motor Corp. reported Wednesday that its quarterly profit rose 21 percent as cost cuts and booming sales in some markets offset the toll from higher U.S. incentives. January-March profit at Toyota  which makes the Camry sedan  Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models  totaled 480.8 billion yen ($4.4 billion)  up from 398 billion yen the same quarter the previous year. Quarterly sales rose nearly 2 percent to 7.58 trillion yen ($69 billion). The absence of past costs related to the massive Takata air-bag inflator recall  which has slammed automakers around the world  also helped results  said Koji Kobayashi  Toyota's executive vice president and chief financial officer. Toyota reported a 2.49 trillion yen ($23 billion) profit for the fiscal year  up 36 percent on-year  on 29.38 trillion yen ($268 billion) sales  up 6 percent. Toyota released results before the Tokyo markets closed  which was surprising. Many big Japanese companies wait until after trading ends to announce earnings — a practice that has been standard for decades. Kobayashi  tapped by President and Chief Executive Akio Toyoda to help guide Japan's top automaker  said the company hopes to grow leaner  staying true to its practice of valuing grassroots input from its workers — a trademark Toyota work style that has inspired manufacturers around the world. Much waste still could be eliminated  he said  pointing to the custom of ""nemawashi "" the traditional Japanese effort to form a consensus before making a decision. The company also creates a lot of internal reference materials that no one really looks at  he said. ""All workers must think like a Toyota person "" he told reporters. Toyota will pursue growth with a strategy of seeing itself as a ""mobility company "" not just an automaker  spending aggressively on research  according to the company. It is banking on artificial intelligence and networking technology  as in connected and self-driving vehicles  to woo consumers. All top automakers and many technology companies are working on similar products and services. Ecological vehicles are another area where competition is heating up. Toyota leads the world in selling gas-electric hybrid vehicles  but has lagged in electric vehicles. It has been working hard to catch up in recent years. Toyoda called his new management team ""the seven samurai "" after the Akira Kurosawa film classic. He said he hopes to turn the major changes happening in the auto industry into a big opportunity for the company. Being a ""mobility company"" means more than pushing ahead with more of the same  but pursuing ""a future that we forge ourselves "" he added. Just like his grandfather Kiichiro Toyoda turned a loom company into an automaker  he must also take up new challenges  Akio Toyoda said. ""We will do more than just survive. We will build toward the future "" he said. In the fiscal year through March  Toyota sold 10.44 million vehicles around the world  up from 10.25 million vehicles the previous fiscal year. It expects to sell 10.5 million vehicles for the year through March 2019  with sales growing in regions other than its main U.S.  Japanese and European markets  such as South America and Africa. ___ Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/09/world/asia/ap-as-japan-earns-toyota.html

business,Higher Oil Price Boosts Profit for Spain's Repsol Advertisement Supported by None MADRID — Spanish oil major Repsol posted an 8 percent year-on-year increase in adjusted first-quarter net profit on Friday  as higher Brent oil prices and increased production offset lower refining margins.  Repsol said higher prices for oil and gas  including a 24 percent rise in Brent over the year  helped push recurring net profit adjusted for one-off gains and inventory effects (CCS net profit) to 616 million euros ($737.6 million) in January-March. This compared with 570 million euros in the same period of the previous year  and was in line with median forecast of 615 million euros drawn from six analysts polled by Reuters. Production rose to 727 barrels per day from 693 a year ago  but the refining margin fell to $6.6 a barrel versus $7.1 a barrel in the first quarter of last year.  Europe's fifth-largest refiner by market value has focused on cost and debt reduction to improve its balance sheet in recent years  leading to credit rating upgrades. Repsol said on Friday its first-quarter results were supported by a decrease in financial costs. Net debt rose 569 million euros from the fourth quarter  to 6.8 billion euros  mainly due to a share buyback undertaken to allow the payment of a scrip dividend.  Credit risk in Venezuela  where political turmoil has led to economic collapse and hyperinflation  prompted a writedown of 433 million euros.

Chesapeake's production rose nearly 5 percent to 554 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd)  while its number of gross wells supplying to the market dropped 25 percent. The Oklahoma-based company's average realized oil price rose 10 percent to $56.89 per barrel in the quarter  while its natural gas price rose nearly 16 percent.  That was in line with the trend among U.S. producers this quarter  who have all benefited from a roughly one-third rise in prices of U.S. light crude <CLc1> compared to a year ago.

business,With Jail Sentences and Corporate Flameouts  China Is Tackling Its Debt Advertisement Supported by None None Faced with the looming consequences of a decade-long borrowing binge  the Chinese government is intensifying its efforts stamp out risky lending and speculative froth from the world’s second-largest economy. To do it  Beijing is putting the brakes on shadowy forms of underground lending and making public spectacles of the worst offenders  even as it takes steps to ensure that small investors and the broader economy are not shaken. None But other signs are emerging  including loan defaults from a growing number of companies and rising interest rates for many borrowers. “Like any deleveraging campaign  it is not painless ” said Christopher Lee  a China credit specialist at S&P Global  said. “There will be losers.” None None “The message there is: You guys need to clean up your own mess and sell whatever you can to fix it ” Mr. Lee said. China has also clamped down on its unruly shadow banking sector  a murky area where non-bank lenders connect borrowers with those willing to lend in exchange for big returns — in many cases  small investors are unaware of potential risks. As a result of new government rules  that money is either drying up or also getting more expensive. For example  the cost of raising money through trust loans — a popular form of shadow banking in China — has risen sharply  from 7 percent to as much as 10 percent over the last 12 months  according to Mr. Lee. The impact is beginning to show. Over the last four days alone  three private Chinese companies have defaulted on debt  telling their bondholders that they cannot make repayments  according to data compiled by S&P Global. So far this year  13 companies have defaulted on bonds  with the pace quickening in recent weeks. Defaults were rare or nonexistent in earlier years  in part because local authorities pressured lenders to forgive or extend missed payment dates to preserve jobs and keep the economy stable. “The intensified regulatory control on shadow banking activities have largely shut down this alternative financing channel ” said Ivan Chung  associate managing director of Greater China credit research at the ratings agency Moody’s. “Weak issuers are more vulnerable to default pressure ” he added. Bankruptcies have shot up  too  with new cases growing by more than half in 2017 compared with the previous year  according to a study by Orient Capital Research. In its report  the research firm said it expected to see a significant increase in defaults by Chinese companies again this year. Overall borrowing has become more expensive for many companies. Bond rates are rising  too  making it more costly for companies to tap that source of money. The Chinese government is playing a careful game. Even as it allows more defaults  last month it poured more money into the financial system to contain the potential damage. It is also sparing larger companies like Anbang. With about 35 million policyholders  Anbang could shake China’s financial system if it collapsed. “With smaller companies  they are not necessarily going to step in ” said Fraser Howie  a former banker in Asia and a co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. He added  “What you’re seeing is that the government is allowing some of them to fail. There are lots of private companies that are defaulting on a daily basis.” Anbang said on Thursday that it had sufficient cash to meet its commitments to customers.

The court found that Mr. Wu had illegally sold insurance products to bolster the company’s financial situation. According to the prosecutors  Mr. Wu instructed employees to falsify financial statements and marketing information in an attempt to skirt regulations and raise money from the public. The sentence was a strong one given the charges  said Yan Yiming  a criminal lawyer in Shanghai. The court on Thursday also said that it had seized Mr. Wu’s bank accounts  real estate and equity. Mr. Wu had initially struck a defiant tone  contesting the charges in March during his only appearance in the court. But facing a potential life sentence  Mr. Wu had pleaded guilty to the charges and asked the court to consider a lighter sentence. “I repent deeply ” Mr. Wu said in March in a televised statement from the court. “I know and regret my crimes.” None Cao Li contributed to reporting from Hong Kong None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/business/china-anbang-wu-xiaohui-debt.html

business,Capturing a Lost Generation in Photographs Advertisement Supported by Art Books When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site  we earn an affiliate commission. None None The documentary filmmaker and photographer Lauren Greenfield’s ambitious new book  “Generation Wealth ” showcases her chronicling of the lifestyles of the rich and famous over the last 20 years. One photo in particular caught my eye  because I happened to be there when it was taken. I’d been interviewing homeless kids in Tucson for a Vanity Fair article in 2003 when Greenfield was sent to take the pictures for it. (The article was never published.) Greenfield’s caption reads: “Jedi has consciously rejected his family’s affluent  mainstream existence in favor of a transient life.” This wasn’t how I remembered the young man  so I checked my transcripts and confirmed that he actually grew up poor and left home  as so many homeless kids do  because of poverty and family issues. I mention this discrepancy not to flag an error  but because I think it’s important to note  when considering a visual collection Greenfield calls “a sociological document ” that photographers are always looking through a certain lens. It’s not that one needs to argue with her thesis (stated in both her lengthy introduction and a foreword by the sociologist Juliet Schor) that income inequality has gotten out of hand  that our obsession with wealth and fame diminishes and dehumanizes us in far-reaching ways. Rather  one ought to ask  whom does Greenfield offer up as examples? And how does she choose to depict them? Many of the subjects featured in this collection are female. The conspicuous consumption on display occurs largely among wealthy women and teenage girls (a young Kim Kardashian makes an appearance)  models and strippers  4- and 5-year-old beauty pageant contestants and prom queens. In her foreword  Schor summarizes this theme as the “objectification of women.” But looking at the images one wonders if they themselves do not also participate in this objectification. These are not kind photographs  some seem to mock their subjects  portraying them as frivolous and shallow  hard and crass. The tone is in keeping with how the wider media has often dealt with our collective anxiety over the fascination with money and fame: by projecting it  with great contempt  onto the bodies and personalities of women and girls  as in reality shows like “Toddlers and Tiaras” and the “Real Housewives” series. Greenfield’s photograph of the 6-year-old “Toddlers and Tiaras” star Eden Wood shows her sticking out her tongue provocatively for the camera  recalling notoriously sexualized images of JonBenet Ramsey. The close-up shot of Jackie Siegel’s breast-augmented cleavage  festooned with a bejeweled necklace  cuts off her head  an alteration that’s arguably as dehumanizing as the very sociological phenomena Greenfield decries. Siegel is the presumptive would-be sovereign on “The Queen of Versailles ” Greenfield’s compelling documentary about the rise and fall of the timeshare mogul David Siegel  who unsuccessfully sued Greenfield for defamation in 2012. Men like Siegel — corporate kingpins who bear much of the blame for the ravages of greed — don’t share as much time in this collection as do women. Unlike their female counterparts  Greenfield’s male subjects aren’t scrounging on the floor for dollar bills or perched on all fours before and after plastic surgery. Mostly  they are seated or standing in their plush offices and homes  looking powerful  if sinister. The photographs in “Generation Wealth” are predominantly of white people. When people of color appear  they are usually not rich. They are gang members in Compton  Calif.  students from Crenshaw High School who’ve been selected by a magazine to be luxuriously outfitted with lent dresses and jewels for prom. Most of the more affluent African-Americans in the collection are hip-hop stars  some displaying their bling (Tupac and Jay-Z are featured). Greenfield claims in her introduction to have found  over the course of this two-decade project  that she was “unearthing a pattern” regarding “the influence of affluence.” But clearly there was another pattern to be found in the types of assignments she was being given. Many of the images in this book accompanied reports that appeared in major publications  from Time to Newsweek to National Geographic. The media’s influence on our obsession with wealth and fame is something she mentions but never probes  but it is there  falling onto the shoulders of the women and girls in her photos who power-shop and proudly display their luxury loot  and perhaps even dream of becoming the next Kim Kardashian.

business,"China Monthly Car Sales Pick Up in April  EV Sales Double Advertisement Supported by None HONG KONG — Chinese passenger car sales expanded at a faster pace last month as growth in the world's biggest auto market picked up steam  an industry group said Friday. Monthly figures from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers show that passenger cars sales in April rose 11 percent over a year earlier to 1.9 million vehicles  outpacing a 3.5 percent growth rate in March. Sales of ""new-energy vehicles"" such as electric cars and gasoline-electric hybrids more than doubled to 82 000. China's communist leaders view electric vehicles as key to transforming China into a technological superpower. Global automakers including General Motors  Nissan and Volkswagen unveiled dozens of electric and hybrid vehicles at the Beijing auto show last month. Recent moves by Beijing to loosen up restrictions on foreign ownership in the auto industry gave priority to the electric vehicle industry. Under the new rules  requirements for foreign car brands to team up with local state-owned partners will be scrapped by 2022  while limits on foreign ownership of electric vehicle producers will be eliminated this year. The relaxed regulations came amid rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China that might dent U.S. auto imports — Ford vehicles are facing longer waits as Chinese customs agents tighten up inspections. The company said its China sales fell 26 percent in April to 69 503 vehicles. China's total vehicle sales including trucks and buses rose 11.5 percent to 2.3 million. The latest numbers are an improvement on uneven sales earlier this year and a lackluster performance last year as sales growth cooled following a surge in 2016 that was driven by tax cuts. Automakers forecast total market growth for China this year of 3 to 4 percent  a fraction of earlier double-digit rates.

business,Supreme Court Divided on Sales Taxes for Online Purchases Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — A closely divided Supreme Court struggled on Tuesday to decide whether internet retailers should have to collect sales taxes in states where they have no physical presence. Brick-and-mortar businesses have long complained that they are disadvantaged by having to charge sales taxes while many of their online competitors do not. States have said that they are missing out on tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue under a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that helped spur the rise of internet shopping. None Several justices expressed concerns about imposing crushing burdens on small businesses that sell goods on the internet and about making them liable for back taxes. Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the case before the court  South Dakota v. Wayfair  No. 17-494  raised “a host of questions” and “a whole new set of difficulties.” Sounding almost plaintive  she added that Congress  rather than the Supreme Court  was the right forum in which to settle the matter. “Is there anything we can do to give Congress a signal that it should act more affirmatively in this area?” Justice Sotomayor asked. But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said that “it would be very strange for us to tell Congress it ought to do something in any particular area.” Both he and Justice Elena Kagan said the fact that Congress has so far chosen not to act was itself a telling indication that it was satisfied with the current system. The chief justice added that the marketplace may already be addressing the problem. “The bigger e-commerce companies find themselves with a physical presence in all 50 states ” he said  “so they’re already covered.” None Justice Gorsuch seemed prepared on Tuesday to reconsider the Quill decision. “Why should this court favor a particular business model?” he asked. None “It is unwise to delay any longer a reconsideration of the court’s holding in Quill ” he wrote. “A case questionable even when decided  Quill now harms states to a degree far greater than could have been anticipated earlier.” South Dakota responded to Justice Kennedy’s invitation by enacting a law that required all merchants to collect a 4.5 percent sales tax if they had more than $100 000 in annual sales or more than 200 individual transactions in the state. State officials sued three large online retailers — Wayfair  Overstock.com and Newegg — for violating the law. “The South Dakota law is obviously a test case ” Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. said on Tuesday. “It was devised to present the most reasonable incarnation of this scheme.” “But do you have any doubt ” Justice Alito asked a lawyer for the federal government  “that states that are tottering on the edge of insolvency and municipalities  which may be in even worse position  have a strong incentive to grab everything they possibly can?” The lawyer  Malcolm L. Stewart  who argued in support of South Dakota  did not disagree. “Many states would adopt regimes that are less hospitable to retailers” if the court allowed them to require the collection of taxes  he said  “unless they were stopped from doing that by Congress.” Justice Alito suggested that a decision from the Supreme Court could short-circuit a more nuanced legislative consideration of the issue. “As things stand now ” he said  “it seems that both the states and internet retailers have an incentive to ask for a congressional solution to this problem.” Lower courts ruled for the online retailers in the South Dakota case  citing the Quill decision. None At Tuesday’s argument  Marty J. Jackley  South Dakota’s attorney general  argued that the Quill decision did not make sense in the digital era. He said that the major practical problem it had identified — that it would be burdensome for out-of-state retailers to calculate and collect taxes for thousands of state and local jurisdictions — had been solved by modern software. But that assertion was hotly disputed by George S. Isaacson  a lawyer for the three internet retailers  who said a ruling against his clients would impose burdens on small online merchants. A national solution  he said  should come from Congress rather than the Supreme Court. Some justices complained that they lacked fundamental information about how hard it is to collect the taxes and how much money is at stake. The two sides  Justice Stephen G. Breyer said  were of little help. Estimates of how much it would cost internet businesses to comply with the tax laws of what were said to be 12 000 state and local jurisdictions varied from $12 to $250 000. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said there could be a market solution  too. “If we did overrule Quill ” she said  “entrepreneurs would produce software that would meet the market need.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/business/justices-divided-on-sales-taxes-for-online-purchases.html
