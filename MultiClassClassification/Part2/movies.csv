https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/movies/the-last-movie-star-review-burt-reynolds.html,Review: Burt Reynolds Confronts His Past in ‘The Last Movie Star’ Advertisement Supported by None “The Last Movie Star” centers on Vic Edwards (Burt Reynolds)  an alcoholic  washed-up actor who travels to a Nashville film festival to receive an honor without realizing that the event is a small-time  back-of-the-bar affair. (The organizer is played by Clark Duke  from “Hot Tub Time Machine ” while Ellar Coltrane of “Boyhood” plays a colleague who peppers Vic with trivia.) Emphasizing how pathetic and lonely Vic has become and how cluelessly the festival treats him — putting him up in seedy lodging  shoving a video camera in his face — the first part of the film is almost as mortifying to watch as it probably is for Vic to experience. We’re meant to regard the festivalgoers as harmless  overly avid fans  but the potshots are too broad and cheap. “The Last Movie Star” takes a turn from cringeworthy fish-out-of-water comedy into anodyne sentimentality when Vic and his incongruously dressed driver  Lil (Ariel Winter) — a goth aspiring artist whose sketches were contributed by the “Hellraiser” director Clive Barker — escape to Vic’s hometown Knoxville  where he makes peace with his past. The director Adam Rifkin wrote this showcase for Mr. Reynolds  who  like Vic  was a college football player. “The Last Movie Star” effectively allows the ever-assured actor to score a touchdown on an empty field. To make it look as if Vic is conversing with his younger self  Mr. Rifkin edits in footage of Mr. Reynolds from “Smokey and the Bandit” and “Deliverance.” It’s a decent idea  but the matching is poor and the clips appear arbitrary.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/opinion/cruise-caribbean-retirement.html,The Happiest Guy in the World Advertisement Supported by Op-Docs None At any given moment across a beach in Fort Lauderdale  Fla.  cruise ships speckle the horizon  their gargantuan bodies reduced to dots in the distance. I grew up near this beach  and most of the people I knew growing up had been on cruises. They would go away for a week or a weekend  drawn by the promise of escape  and return to land with bad sunburns  stories of small adventures and a few extra pounds. For these people  cruising was an occasional vacation. For Mario Salcedo  the subject of this Op-Doc  it’s his everyday life. I first learned about Mario through my grandparents  both of whom are avid cruisers. As several of their senior friends began to spend more time on cruises than on land  my grandparents became aware of an elite cabal of sorts within the cruising subculture: passengers scattered across different cruise lines who choose to live at sea permanently. One such passenger was Mario Salcedo  or “Super Mario” as the crew of the Enchantment of the Seas affectionately calls him. For the past two decades  Mario has been a full-time resident on Royal Caribbean Cruises  accumulating over 7 300 nights at sea. None For nearly two decades  Mario had been living out of his suitcase  traveling extensively for his corporate job as the director of international finance at a multinational corporation. He spent more time in and out of hotel rooms scattered across Latin America than he did at his home in Miami. After working nonstop for nearly 21 years  Mario — burned out — decided it was time to pursue a lifelong goal: to travel around the world  without leaving home. In 1997  he quit his job  packed an even bigger suitcase and quietly disappeared from the lives of his friends and family to pursue a new life on the open water. This past August  a film crew of me and four others joined Mario for five days on the Enchantment of the Seas. As we soon discovered  Mario lives a far different life from the one portrayed by both himself — as an unofficial public ambassador for Royal Caribbean — and the press. The Mario we followed was not living the fantastical dream life of a “cruising king ” as I’d seen him described. The Mario we found lives a life full of paradoxes: while he proclaims his independence from others  he surrounds himself with throngs of anonymous tourists  shaking hands and selling his lifestyle. I was determined to crack through what I perceived to be a facade. But as I floated dreamily across a sea of professional smiles with Mario  I realized that his facade had taken on a reality of its own  that his ongoing voyages to nowhere — and everywhere — provided an overwhelming sense of freedom perhaps not found on land. It is in that freedom that Mario has finally found his home. None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/20/movies/the-lego-ninjago-movie-review.html,Review: ‘The Lego Ninjago Movie’ Sticks to the Instruction Manual Advertisement Supported by None “When are the Wegos coming on?” the young boy sitting next to me asked his father. His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were  five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie ” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan  a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks. Soon enough  the Wegos awwived  and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway  a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion  winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there  and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity. None Garmadon  who wants to be a mayor  is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son  Lloyd (Dave Franco)  is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd  whose alter ego is the Green Ninja  works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun? Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor  their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired  cynical  sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery. A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs  freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation  and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies. None “She’s a girl and a ninja! Can she have it all?” a voice-over asks sardonically  trying to make a self-conscious joke at the expense of the movie’s own imaginative limitations. “You fellas need to inform yourselves on where we’re at culturally ” the lady ninja retorts. It’s a good line  but also one that the writers and directors — fellas to a man — might have taken a bit more to heart. Or maybe they did  and this is just where we’re at culturally.

None None During his presidency  Ronald Reagan and his wife  Nancy  watched 363 movies at Camp David. Spread out over eight years  it’s a pardonably large total  especially for two former film actors  a couple who retained show business as a frame of reference long after they’d gone into its professional cousin  politics. All their viewing of the era’s biggest hits probably kept the Reagans more connected to the country than watching four hours a day of cable news. Mark Weinberg  a young press aide detailed to Camp David on the weekends  would join a group of staffers in Aspen Lodge each time the president opened the door just before 8 p.m. Everyone would watch the films  and the staffers would also watch their hosts. More than 30 years later  with the former first lady’s blessing  Weinberg began writing this amiable book about the experience. “Movie Nights With the Reagans” is fluffed with a loyalist’s nostalgia  but it does offer entertaining glimpses of the first couple  and it may lure even Reagan nonenthusiasts to indulge in some nostalgia of their own.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/02/world/europe/ap-eu-italy-berlusconi-movie.html,"New Italian Movie Explores Berlusconi's Relations With Women Advertisement Supported by None ROME — Italian voters' love affair with Silvio Berlusconi may be waning  judging by the slumping fortunes of his Forza Italia party in recent elections. But Italians are invited to explore the politician's relations with women in a new film by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino. The director on Wednesday described his film ""Loro"" (Them) as neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi — but instead tries to contemplate the ""feelings"" of the now 81-year-old ex-premier and media mogul toward his wife  who later sought a divorce  citing his keen interest in very young women. ""It is not an ideological film or a film that takes a side "" Sorrentino insisted to reporters after he screened the film in a Rome movie house. ""On the contrary  it's just the opposite."" Instead  so far  what ""hasn't been emphasized was the dimension of the feelings that were behind the political man "" he said. The director described his latest film as also exploring people's fear of old age and death. ""Berlusconi's fear of old age and death is the fear we all have "" he said. Berlusconi  who served three terms as premier  cannot currently hold office due to a tax fraud conviction  so he couldn't run for a fourth term in March 4 elections. But he still leads the center-right political party he created in the early 1990s. Italians were fiercely divided when Berlusconi used his media empire as a springboard into politics. Detractors feared he wanted to use his political power to protect his business interests. Admirers saw him as a fresh  straight-talking  can-do figure after decades of byzantine politics yielding short-lived governments. Sorrentino's ""The Great Beauty "" which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film  described the decadent political environment in Rome. His 2016 ""Youth -- La giovinezza"" described aging men's struggle with dwindling sexual energies. His latest film probes the collapse of Berlusconi's second marriage  to Veronica Lario  and her disappointment at the unraveling of their relationship. The backdrop for much of the film is a Sardinian villa  and the film features decadent parties there with lots of single young women present as Berlusconi's guests. But the movie doesn't cover Berlusconi's notorious ""bunga bunga"" sex-fueled parties at his Italian mainland homes — or the related legal woes that plagued him. Berlusconi  who has insisted that those evenings with his guests were ""elegant soirees"" with clean-cut entertainment  was acquitted on appeal of paying for sex with an underage woman. Italian actor Toni Servillo plays Berlusconi in the film  which is divided in two parts: ""Loro 1"" and ""Loro 2."" The first part opened in Italian cinemas last week  while ""Loro 2"" opens May 10. One of Italy's most acclaimed theater and screen actors  Servillo has played another iconic Italian politician  former seven-time premier Giulio Andreotti  in Sorrentino's movie  ""Il divo."" While Andreotti was a man who ""moved through the palaces of politics as an introvert "" Servillo said Berlusconi is an ""extroverted diva who puts himself at the center of the political scene...waiting only for the moment to come back"" to the center of politics. Italian newspaper ""Il Fatto Quotidiano "" known for its anti-Berlusconi stance  said Sorrentino with ""Loro"" effectively ""sanctions the recognition in the (not only) Italian collective imagination of the end of a personality  who already belongs to this country's past history."" ___ Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/the-road-movie-review.html,Review: In ‘The Road Movie ’ Russian Highways Are the Final Frontier Advertisement Supported by None None Compiled entirely from real Russian dashboard camera videos  the movie is an experimental assemblage with no overarching plot or recurring characters. Instead  common cultural character emerges from dozens of disparate sketches. As if he were assembling a collection of Russian scary stories  the director Dmitrii Kalashnikov makes the bizarre beguiling. Early on  a dashboard camera captures a green light as it burns across the horizon. The men who witness the light as they’re driving debate if they’ve seen a comet or a crashing plane  but on video the flash looks alien  like a probe from a foreign and hostile universe. Even when the danger turns out to be terrestrial in nature  “The Road Movie” always retains this same senseless strangeness. With every cut to a different camera  a surreal episode unfolds with a new menace. A couple drives through a forest fire so hot  the flames appear purple. When they aren’t avoiding crashes  drivers are threatened with guns  sledgehammers and hatchets. Without explanation  a man jumps on the hood of a stranger’s car  beating the glass first with his fists and then with his head. Perhaps strangest still is that throughout the bedlam  the drivers rarely betray their shock. They are under constant siege  but the only crack in their collective stoicism is the reliance on cameras to capture the chaos. The camera offers no protection  it only provides a witness. Fortunately for audiences  it’s more pleasurable to witness anarchy than it is to experience it. Movie data powered by IMDb.com Not rated. In Russian with English subtitles.

Advertisement Supported by When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site  we earn an affiliate commission. None Considered on its own  as a single  nearly 2-hour-40-minute movie  “Avengers: Infinity War” makes very little sense  apart from the near convergence of its title and its running time. Early on  someone menacingly (and presciently) says  “You may think this is suffering. No: It’s salvation.” That’s a bit overstated either way. It’s puzzlement and irritation and also  yes  delight. But of course this film  the 19th installment in a series  was never meant to be viewed or judged in isolation. In that respect it shouldn’t really be thought of as a movie at all  at least in the ways people with jobs like mine are accustomed to using the word. Which poses a few difficulties  for me and also  I would argue  for you. None None None Those interesting  unusual specimens — what we used to think of  in simpler times  as “good movies” — aren’t exactly accidents. They are carefully planned exceptions that uphold a rule (meaning a regime as well as a norm) of passive acceptance disguised as enthusiasm. This universe is engineered for variety and inclusiveness  within certain strict parameters. Above all  the Disney-Marvel combination is a giant machine that manufactures maximum consent. The cosmos is theirs. The rest of us just live in it. None And of course it is with respect to “spoilers” that the policing of discourse is most ruthlessly and effectively practiced. Reviewers who attend advance screenings take a vow of silence about plot details that will be widely known within a week and all but forgotten a week after that. Government secrets are guarded with less care  and requests from public officials to go off the record are addressed with more skepticism. But if I mention which superhero dies  or which one has an unexpected relationship with someone else — well  I wouldn’t dream of it. Not because I’m afraid of Disney executives. It’s the wrath of their obedient  weaponized minions I fear. In other words: you. This is not a healthy situation. The reasonable concern that major plot elements not be divulged has spawned a phobic  hypersensitive taboo against public discussion of anything that happens onscreen. If  for example  I were to share that Thor (Chris Hemsworth) mistakes Rocket (Bradley Cooper)  who is a raccoon  for a rabbit — whoops  you already hit “send ” didn’t you? The joke is repeated a half-dozen times  so it kind of ruins itself. And until the end  the whole thing is weirdly free of any but the most superficial  mechanical surprises. The action is especially tedious and predictable. I mean both the scenes of fighting and flying and the overall rhythm of the first two hours or so. People talk for a while  sprinkling jokes and morsels of personality into the heavy dough of exposition. Then they fight in the usual way  by throwing giant objects (and one another) and shooting waves of color from their hands. The noisy  bloated spectacles of combat were surely the most expensive parts of the movie  but the money seems less like an imaginative tool than a substitute for genuine imagination. There is so much to explain  but basically a large purple fellow named Thanos (Josh Brolin) wants  on vague Malthusian principles  to wipe out half the life in the universe. As you try to keep track of all the good guys massed against him  you may decide he has a point. But he’s not a bad villain. I mean  he’s very bad  but his malevolence is laced with melancholy  and there is a ghastly grandeur to his ambition. To fulfill his evil plans  Thanos needs to collect six “infinity stones ” which in spite of their awesome power look a lot like what you would find in the craft kit you have been meaning to regift since your kid’s seventh birthday. Also  come on: Another quest for magic gewgaws? This one lumbers from Vormir to Knowhere to Titan  with terrestrial stops in New York  Scotland and Wakanda. Along the way  Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) stage a Sherlock Holmes meta-duel and compare goatees. The hunky-Chris showdown — Hemsworth vs. Pratt (Peter Quill) vs. Evans (Captain America) — ends in a three-way tie. Zoe Saldana is heartbreaking as Gamora. If you end up wanting more Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) or War Machine (Don Cheadle)  or whoever your favorite happens to be — well  that’s kind of the idea  isn’t it? But where you end up may not be where you thought this was going. The final act  including the post-credits sting (to infinity and beyond  as it were) brings a chill  a darkness and a hush that represent something new in this universe. “Infinity War” is the first half of the final installment in the series  and it concludes with a premonition of finality. Its intimations of grief and terror feel shrewdly attuned to what is happening in the actual  unmarvelous world. But those emotions can also be folded back into the movies themselves.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/movies/avengers-infinity-war-ending.html,Does the Ending of ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ Spoil Itself? Advertisement Supported by None The following piece discusses details from the ending of “Avengers: Infinity War.”  I’m not good enough at math to calculate whether the percentage of the world’s population who saw “Avengers: Infinity War” over the weekend corresponds to the proportion of Marvel superheroes — spoiler alert! — killed at the end of the movie. I suspect  though  that many people who haven’t seen it yet are already aware of what happens. A lot of superheroes die  perhaps including some of your favorites. T’Challa  we hardly knew you! None By which time the point was moot. Before “Avengers: Infinity War” had been in theaters even a full day  a barrage of post-review think pieces appeared discussing and dissecting the bleakness  most of them dutifully adorned with warnings not to read any further if you wanted to preserve your innocence. And no wonder. The last moments of the film are by far the most interesting. They bring intimations of darkness and grief that feel like something new in the Marvel Universe. The bad guy (his name is Thanos and his chin is remarkable) not only wins  but triumphs in a way that brings despair rather than sequel-setting rage or defiance. His victims don’t go down fighting  they turn to dust and drift away in the breeze  watching as their friends and their own limbs decompose. It’s a reverse rapture  with a somber emotional payoff. None How seriously are we supposed to take it? There is another “Avengers” movie coming next year  which along with this one is meant to represent a finale of sorts. But of course it’s not really the end. The Marvel Cinematic Universe will keep expanding: release dates are already in place into the next decade  and if Disney’s acquisition of Fox goes through there will be fresh crossover opportunities. Thanos  when he kills Loki early in “Infinity War ” promises “no resurrections” this time. The intricate logic of the plot  however — there are these magic stones that give their possessor the ability  among other things  to reorder time — suggests a route back to life for Black Panther  Spider-Man and the other dead heroes. Dr. Strange  who can see into the future  might have offered a cryptic prediction to that effect. And here in the real world  plenty of fans and critics have assumed that the next Avengers movie will cook up an escape clause. Kevin Feige  the head of Marvel Studios  has insisted otherwise. Why would he lie? Would reversing the movie’s ending constitute its own kind of spoiler  cheapening the shock and grief that make “Infinity War” distinctive? Movies play with death all the time  turning horror into joy as a way of asserting both their power over our emotions and their marvelous unreality. E.T.’s death is shattering  and also temporary. Vincent Vega  John Travolta’s “Pulp Fiction” hit man  is gunned down in a bathroom in the middle  only to walk out of the diner into the sunshine at the end  revived by the simple secular magic of chronological reordering. Comic books have thrived by granting their characters multiple lives and story-lines  allowing them to be both mortal and immortal. Life may be short  but intellectual property is eternal  and that may be the real spoiler. Marvel and Disney have gone to great trouble and expense to make us care and keep us interested  pouring money and talent into a series of movies whose commercial success is one of the inarguable achievements of our time. Which may be the problem. There will always be more  which limits both the possibility of surprise and the intensity of feeling that any single episode can deliver. At the end of “Infinity War” you don’t need to tell yourself that it’s only a movie  because it isn’t a movie. It’s a piece of matter in a post-cinematic universe.

Incredibly  “Infinity War” sprinted to first place without the enormous markets of China or Russia  where it will open in the next two weeks.

Advertisement Supported by None None None With these duties out of the way  the Russo brothers have one more assignment to complete: successfully bringing the curtain down on the most lucrative franchise in Hollywood history. The 18 movies that preceded “Infinity War” were a risky feat unto themselves: a multihour narrative in which each installment handed off to the next — sometimes elegantly  sometimes awkwardly — and events in previous episodes had lasting effects on those that followed. Now Marvel is trying something equally unprecedented and potentially far riskier. In “Infinity War” and a subsequent “Avengers” movie that will open in May 2019  the Russos need to seamlessly incorporate dozens of major characters  all while bringing the franchise to a satisfying conclusion. “We’re not making any bones about the fact that we’re ending the first 10 years ” Joe Russo said later that night. “That’s what we pushed for.” None None None Now Marvel says it wants to clear the table it has spent the last 10 years arranging and make way for something new. “Telling a great story requires a great ending ” Kevin Feige  the Marvel Studios president  said. “When you dedicate yourself to that  it shifts the way you think.” Audiences are about to find out what finality looks like for a motion-picture money-minting machine: Will the story actually come to a conclusion? Will characters die  and will actors leave the series? Whatever the answers  they have already been reached with the help of the Russo brothers  two of Marvel’s most consistent and diligent — if not widely recognized — filmmakers. When they finish their “Avengers” movies  which they shot back to back over 18 months  the Russos will complete their own improbable arc  from indie-cinema oddballs to TV comedy moguls to directors of possibly the biggest franchise in movie history. The brothers — Anthony  48  the bespectacled brainstormer  and Joe  46  the square-jawed pragmatist — have contrasting but complementary energies. As Mr. Downey described them  Anthony is “a bit more reflective  a yin guy ” while Joe is the intense yang of the partnership: “Bitcoin was invented to keep Joe Russo from killing himself during the last 20 percent of the shoot ” Mr. Downey said. When they’re together  Mr. Downey added  “It’s like the two of them make a third thing that’s better than any one person could be.” None As Anthony Russo explained it  “The virtue of growing up in the industrial Midwest is you have nothing to rub up against you and no one to tell you that you can’t do what you want to do  because nobody’s doing anything. You can just be a dreamer.” None None None Despite critical acclaim  “Arrested Development” got notoriously low ratings. But the Russos said this lack of attention was a blessing in disguise  allowing them to experiment with narrative  tone and pacing  unencumbered by interfering network executives. “They so didn’t get the show that they really didn’t care what you did ” Anthony Russo said  adding  “It was a huge creative upside.” None At the time  the studio was generating hits with its earliest superhero offerings  made by established filmmakers — “Iron Man ” directed by Jon Favreau  “Captain America: The First Avenger ” directed by Joe Johnston. But Marvel wanted to expand its portfolio rapidly and bring in TV directors. None “The first one was a fairly patriotic  gung-ho World War II movie ” said Christopher Markus  who wrote the “Captain America” films with Stephen McFeely. “You can’t make a string of those before you get slightly nauseous.” The goal of “The Winter Soldier ” Mr. Markus said  was to show Captain America “losing faith in all the institutions that had made him  giving you a way to see him as relevant in the modern era.” The Russos envisioned “The Winter Soldier” as a modern-day upgrade of espionage thrillers like “Three Days of the Condor ” and the studio responded strongly. When the movie sold $714 million in tickets worldwide  Mr. Feige said the Russos “redefined the franchise — not just the Cap franchise but all the Marvel movies going forward.” “They found a way to keep the wonder  keep the spectacle  but ground it even more in realism ” Mr. Feige said. “Which is a word I use lightly when it comes to our movies.” None Even before “Civil War” became a $1.15 billion global smash  Marvel had already started putting the pieces in place for what Mr. Feige called “the big finale of the initial story line we were developing.” The plan was ambitious: Mr. Markus and Mr. McFeely would write two “Avengers” movies  generated from a 60-page manifesto they started working on in 2015. All the major Marvel heroes had to be accommodated  and still more characters would be introduced. “Not every scene can be 25 people in a room ” Mr. McFeely said. “You’re going to have to make kickball teams and then have a tournament.” With scripts in hand  the Russos would film these movies consecutively. In Mr. Feige’s mind  there were no other directors who could handle the task of doing “three straight years of filmmaking.” Mr. Feige said  “There are two of them  which helps. But their individual stamina is unmatched.” The Russos moved from Los Angeles to Georgia for two years  where “Avengers: Infinity War” and its sequel were shot  principally at Pinewood Atlanta Studios. (They estimate that they took a break of about three weeks between filming the two movies.) They said making the movies this way was an irresistible challenge — one that has been attempted by very few directors  including the Wachowskis (“The Matrix” series) and Peter Jackson (the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” franchises) — and a test of their fortitude. Describing the process  Anthony Russo said  “You’re a really good marathon runner and you know how to train for it. All of a sudden  you’re running a double marathon. You can’t really understand it until you do it.” The Russos acknowledge that the films were made this way  in part  for economic reasons: it’s cheaper for Marvel to hire actors — dozens of them  some of whom are very costly — for months at a time  rather than make individual deals for each movie. Though they must serve many corporate masters at Disney and Marvel  and Mr. Feige is known for having a strong hand in his films  the Russos say they were given the latitude to make the movies they want to make. “It’s no different than making any kind of narrative in a medium where capitalism thrives ” Joe Russo said. “You have to have a Zen resilience about what it is that you want to do  and then do a really good job at it. And everybody stays out of your hair.” Mr. Downey  who first worked with the Russos on “Civil War ” said they were well served by their TV training  which has taught them to be quick and collaborative. At any given moment on these films  Mr. Downey said  “we’ve got 80 things that are going to blow up  collide — story points that are all about to happen at once.” When one of the Russos had a new idea  he said  they would approach him with a gentle query: “Let me pitch you this.” “No one takes it personally  and then the idea emerges ” Mr. Downey said. “It ends up an amalgam of everything that didn’t hit the floor.” The Russos aren’t revealing much about how  exactly  their “Avengers” movies will bring closure to this phase of the Marvel cinematic saga. (They wouldn’t even disclose the title of the movie that follows “Infinity War ” protesting that even this much information would be a spoiler.) “Ultimately ” Joe Russo said  “what you’ll see by the end of the movies is  what does it cost to be a hero in a world where there are no easy answers? I think that’s the world we live in.” Death is a staple of comic books. Beloved characters are killed off all the time  sometimes replaced by successors who inherit their costumes and identities: Bucky becomes the new Captain America  Jane Foster the new Thor. There’s no reason to believe that their motion-picture counterparts aren’t similarly mortal and similarly interchangeable. None He talked about his time with Marvel in retrospective tones  and reflected on an encounter with Keanu Reeves  who at the time had just finished making the first “Matrix” movie. “I was like  ‘Hey  dude  how’d it go?’” Mr. Downey recalled. “He said  ‘I’ve been on another planet.’ Right now  I’ve been on the planet Dolittle for a while. Being detached from it has given me a lot of warmth  affection and objectivity about this past decade.” Of course  the Marvel engine will keep chugging away. “There will be more movies with some of these characters ” Mr. Feige said  “and with lots of new characters.” None “We’d love to have all the characters back ” Mr. Feige said. “It’s a dream. But we’re plenty busy with the next five films.” None The brothers are elliptical about whether there are more Marvel movies in their future. “We wanted to maximize our options as storytellers and artists ” Anthony Russo said. “We’ve structured our business life in a way to support that. It can be  or it can’t be. We’ve kept all options open.” Joe Russo said there are still some “very personal projects we want to make ” adding that he and Anthony want to nurture up-and-coming filmmakers just as Mr. Soderbergh did for them. “We owe a karmic debt to the universe because of what Steven did for us ” he said. The reality  though  is that the Russos are not even finished with “Avengers.” Once “Infinity War” is released  there is still a whole additional movie for them to construct from untold hours of raw footage  a task that they estimate will take them at least until the end of the year. “There are months of work left on it ” Anthony Russo said. “It will be very cathartic for us to come out the other end. That’s when our brains can open up to what’s next.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies

That movie is scheduled for release on May 3  2019. Details of the plot have not been released.  Iger added that Disney would also likely ""try our hand at what I'll call a new franchise beyond Avengers "" noting that there were some 7 000 characters in the Marvel universe that could be explored in film.

The Walt Disney Co. said Sunday that ""Avengers: Infinity War"" will gross an estimated $112.5 million from North American theaters over the weekend  becoming the second highest grossing film in weekend two behind ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens'"" $149.2 million and just slightly ahead of ""Black Panther"" ($111.7 million). It's a 56 percent drop from its first weekend in theaters — less steep than the second weekend fall of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (59.4 percent) or ""Captain America: Civil War"" (59.5 percent)  but more than ""Black Panther's"" uniquely soft 44.7 percent sophomore weekend decline. ""We're in uncharted territory again "" said comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. ""This is a second weekend number that many films would aspire to have on opening weekend."" Globally  ""Avengers: Infinity War"" has now grossed over $1.2 billion and become the first film ever to cross the $1 billion mark in 11 days of release  and it has yet to even open in China. There was little new competition this weekend in the blockbuster space  although there were a handful of other options  like ""Overboard "" which came in a very distant second to ""Avengers "" but still made a notable splash for a film its size. MGM and Lionsgate's Pantelion Films' gender-swapped remake of Garry Marshall's 1987 comedy  ""Overboard"" scored the highest-grossing opening weekend for Pantelion Films with a better-than-expected $14.8 million from 1 623 theaters. It's already surpassed its modest mid-teens production budget. Pantelion Films CEO Paul Presburger and Jonathan Glickman  president of the Motion Picture Group at MGM  both attribute the success to the star-power of Eugenio Derbez (""Instructions Not Included "" ''How to be a Latin Lover"") who helped developed the bilingual remake with an American star (Anna Faris) to appeal not just to his Hispanic fan base but all audiences. The cast  including Derbez and Eva Longoria  helped promote the film on their social media accounts too. ""It's great to have a large base especially in the wake of 'Avengers '"" Presburger said. ""We have a movie out there that plays to families and all audiences that should have success into Mother's Day and onwards."" Although critics were not especially won over by ""Overboard "" audiences gave the film a more favorable A- CinemaScore. Third place went to ""A Quiet Place "" which has grossed $159.9 million in five weeks in theaters  and fourth place to ""I Feel Pretty "" now up to $37.8 million in weekend three. ""Rampage"" rounded out the top five with $4.6 million  bumping its domestic total to $84.8 million. In sixth place  ""Tully "" starring Charlize Theron  launched on 1 353 screens with $3.2 million. It's the third collaboration between director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody  the team behind ""Juno "" and their second with Theron  who also starred in their film ""Young Adult."" Hollywood's summer movie season typically runs from the first weekend in May through Labor Day  but this year got a jump-start with the late April release of ""Avengers: Infinity War.""

Ms. Goldberg asks whether there is a “pee tape” from President Trump’s stay in a Russian hotel suite. Mr. Trump’s persistent reluctance to criticize the Russian president  Vladimir Putin  or take strong action against Russia despite the advice of his senior staff makes us wonder if the answer is “yes.” DANIEL FINK  BEVERLY HILLS  CALIF. To the Editor: I have no idea where the Mueller investigation is headed or what evidence there may or may not be against anyone connected to it. But I am certain of one thing. It is tearing this country apart slowly. The speculation  the innuendo  the political sniping by those on both sides of the aisle are eating us alive like a political virus. For the sake of the country  Robert Mueller needs to wrap up his investigation with regard to the guilt or innocence of the president specifically. Every day that this drags out serves only to further divide us  and delays the much needed healing process. TONY LAMANTIA  CHICAGO To the Editor: None It is customary and proper for someone in the media with an interest in a matter to disclose that interest before launching an attack on others involved in that matter. Of course that apparently applies only to those working for genuinely responsible media outlets. So it comes as no surprise that Sean Hannity of Fox News failed to mention that he had consulted with Michael Cohen before launching a vitriolic attack against Robert Mueller and the F.B.I. after the raid on Mr. Cohen’s properties. Now Mr. Hannity states he had “de minimis discussions” with Mr. Cohen on real estate matters. There’s nothing to say that this is not the case. However  to conceal it is neither “fair” nor “balanced ” though should one really expect anything else?

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/opinion/russia-britain-theresa-may.html,Hitting Putin Where It Hurts Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None None None None But the prime minister should have gone in harder. If she really wanted to teach Russia a lesson  she should have announced measures allowing her government to scrutinize the billions of dollars invested in Britain by Russian oligarchs and their associates  some of whom have criminal or intelligence backgrounds. This kind of transparency would hit President Vladimir Putin and his allies where it hurts most: their bank accounts. None None Mrs. May probably has her reasons for not going forward with the law. She is the country’s weakest prime minister to assume office since World War II. Brexit has not only polarized public opinion but also created bitter divisions in her cabinet  and several ministers are open about their desire to take her place. Because of this  she has had to handle the relationship with Russia after the murder attempt with great care. If she gets it wrong  her already enfeebled administration could collapse. None Mr. Putin may have realized how weak Mrs. May is  which is why he would decide to act now to take revenge on a man he sees as a traitor and to cause Britain new headaches. Russia’s motivation is understandable. Its economy faces serious structural problems  including a dangerous overreliance on oil and gas. At the same time  business leaders are worried about the country’s long-term demographic decline. Mr. Putin seeks to bolster his domestic popularity by looking powerful as he sows discord with the West. And Britain has made itself an easy target for Russian intrigue. To be fair  this is not a problem of Mrs. May’s making. The government is reaping the dubious rewards of having opened the City of London since the late 1990s to foreign capital with no questions asked about its origin. The initial aim of this permissive approach was to persuade investors that London — rather than New York — was best suited to be the world’s financial capital. Among the many to take advantage of the light-touch regulations were oligarchs  spies and gangsters. Britain needs to make a concerted effort to ascertain where all of this fabulous wealth comes from. Russian oligarchs have made an indelible mark on London. Some own newspapers  others our most successful soccer clubs  while many more own huge chunks of high-end property in the most fashionable parts of the capital. And some of those characters are close collaborators and friends of President Putin. British newspapers have been full of articles about Russian oligarchs and their relatives buying luxury London houses through anonymous companies. Reports say that this is now an ever more popular trick — squirreling away corrupt money by passing it on to relatives in the hope that it will evade scrutiny. If Mrs. May is convinced that Russia is behind this attack  then she needs to devise a way of getting to President Putin’s friends and collaborators. And that means great transparency. She should reintroduce the stalled proposal to force anonymous companies to reveal the sources of their cash. If any members of Parliament or the cabinet tried to oppose a move now  their motives would immediately look suspicious. Now is the moment to confound her critics by acting decisively. If Britain knows where the money is coming from  it can develop smarter sanctions against Mr. Putin’s inner circle. But that information has the added advantage of making it easier to spot criminal money from across the world being laundered through London’s real estate and financial industries. If Moscow is indeed responsible for the poisoning of Mr. Skripal and his daughter  then the attempted murders look like another tactic in a strategy that seeks to exploit the political vulnerabilities of our democracies. But unlike fake news and the meddling in elections  this one could prove deadly. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/opinion/nancy-pelosi-conor-lamb.html,And Now  the Nancy Pelosi Drama Advertisement Supported by None So  what about Nancy Pelosi? One of the more dramatic sidelights in that dramatic congressional election in Pennsylvania was the way Republicans attempted to turn the whole campaign into a Pelosi referendum. If you lived in the Pittsburgh area  you saw multitudinous ads warning that Democrat Conor Lamb would “join Pelosi’s liberal flock” if he won. People there will probably spend the spring wandering around muttering “Nancy Pelosi and Conor Lamb Are Still Opposing Your Tax Cut.” “You cannot watch TV at any time of the day or night without seeing the ‘mudslinging’ campaigns ” one reader complained to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It’s tough  all the advertising overkill that comes with a tight election. Those of us who live in districts where the typical contest is a 12-term incumbent versus anything the opposition can dig up — a woman who just moved into the state  a guy who just got out of prison on an arson conviction  a 12-year-old Chihuahua — are so lucky. For Pelosi  the only downside to Lamb’s victory was the part where he promised he’d never vote to keep her on as leader. (“My take is  if these people have been around for several years and they haven’t solved these problems that have been hanging around  it’s time for someone new to step up and get it done.”) So what does this all mean? A) Pelosi loses! How many other Democrats in tough races will promise to replace her? It’s a hell of a lot easier than balancing the budget. B) Pelosi wins! Look  she would have been perfectly happy to have Lamb call her a voodoo-priestess puppy-killer if it got her another seat. C) Republicans self-immolate! People who bet their political fortunes on the presumption that voters care who’s the House minority leader deserve what they get. O.K.  it’s very possible that your average voter is not all that obsessed with Nancy Pelosi. But I know you’re different  concerned citizen. And she really has been through a lot. David Barker  a government professor at American University  thinks the Republican effort to portray Pelosi as an uber-villain “may be unique  historically speaking.” And the reason  Barker adds  has to be “at least partially related to gender.” Pelosi doesn’t really love the idea that the Republicans’ hatred is about sexism. “I don’t think it’s because I’m a woman. It’s because I’m an effective leader ” she said in a phone interview. Or it could be both. Pelosi is famous as a behind-the-scenes tactician. When the Democrats controlled the House and Barack Obama was president  she single-handedly dragged the Affordable Care Act to passage like a firefighter rescuing a comatose 300-pound fifth-floor resident from a burning building. And as a fund-raiser  she’s a veritable vacuum cleaner. She sounds as if she wants to stay. “I wouldn’t give that up lightly ” she said of her job. “Nor do the women of the country want me to.” But the Democrats in the House aren’t all enthusiastic. Some have been saying they want a leader who’s younger  more open to new ideas  less likely to become a political meme for the opposition. “I do think it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation ” said Representative Linda Sánchez  49  in a recent TV interview. You do have to admit the Democratic leadership is looking a little … non-fresh. Pelosi turns 78 this month. The next two people in line — Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn — are equally senior. “And why is it that the only one being pressured to leave is a woman?” demanded one of Pelosi’s friends. Well  probably because she’s on top. Although if she was replaced by the 78-year-old Hoyer  that would be pretty embarrassing. And some of the younger Democrats who are mentioned most often as possible successors — like 56-year-old Representative Joe Crowley of Queens — aren’t exactly new brooms. The ideal solution — except for the other Democrats who are eyeing her job — might be for Pelosi to come back with a new message. Maybe she could follow the Republican lead and impose term limits on committee leadership jobs  giving junior members a chance to shine. The Democrats haven’t done this because of opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus  which argues that the current seniority system is good for minority members. It’s certainly good for the veteran minority members who have important posts they can keep forever. But the younger  ambitious black House Democrats are stuck in the same clogged system as their white counterparts. If the public thinks Pelosi is less than inspiring  that’s probably because making messy political bargains and fund-raising aren’t exactly celebrated skills these days. Polls show House Speaker Paul Ryan is equally (un)popular. And he’s now being Pelosi-ed by a Democratic super PAC with a new ad showing a man who’s supposed to be Ryan drinking champagne  admiring his hair and working out in the gym in the most self-obsessed manner possible. “Whoever Speaker Ryan thinks about — it probably isn’t you ” the narrator warns. Plus  there’s that election in November. Right now  it seems as if nothing can save the Republican majority. Not even promising to get rid of Paul Ryan. Although it probably wouldn’t hurt. Guess Pelosi wins. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies

Advertisement Supported by None CANNES  France — A gripping whodunnit with barnstorming performances  or a ""telenovela"" melodrama: critical reactions were mixed on Wednesday for ""Everybody Knows""  which opened the Cannes Film Festival. Real-life couple Penelope Cruz and Javier Bardem star in the Spanish-language movie written and directed by the double-Oscar winner Iranian Asghar Farhadi  about a Spanish village hit by a terrible crime. Cruz plays Laura  who leaves her husband behind in Argentina for a trip with their son and daughter to a family wedding in the village where she grew up. Paco  (Bardem)  her former lover  is the life and soul of the party  until things take a shocking turn. ""It is  of course  a thriller "" Farhadi told a news conference  adding that the genre plot was more of an ""excuse"" - a way to investigate the behavior of people thrust into unthinkable circumstances. Perhaps because of sky-high expectations for a film with A-list actors and a director revered for critical hits ""A Separation"" and ""The Salesman""  reviews were mixed. ""Farhadi’s weakest film yet is still better than the vast majority of commercially made dramas in Spain  France or the United States "" wrote Variety's Chief Film Critic Peter Debruge. While it has strong echoes of Farhadi’s breakthrough film ""About Elly"" about a woman who disappears from a beach in Iran  ""Everybody Knows"" is  as Bardem said  ""one of the most Spanish films a director could make"". ""For me what he has done is incredible  being Iranian and making a Spanish movie in Spanish language and there are no clichés  it’s just incredible ” Cruz told Reuters. The Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said: ""the southern European setting has given Farhadi’s filmic language a new sanguine force""  while Variety's Debruge took a dimmer view. ""Farhadi’s career is starting to look suspiciously like Woody Allen’s  as he jets off to make sunlit movies starring beautiful people in one European country after another. Globe-trotting is well and good  except one hopes the immensely talented auteur ... would use the opportunity of working abroad to be a bit more provocative."" IndieWire's Eric Kohn said “Everybody Knows” veers towards the ""soapy""  with a plot twist ""that wouldn’t feel out of place in a telenovela""  but the film's ""explosive star power"" help it make ""remarkable observations about the impact of class and status under dire circumstances"".

Mr. Rudin said the efforts by the estate to assert control over the script had already damaged the process  making it difficult to secure the money needed to finance the production. “Investors are not willing to invest millions of dollars when a cloud exists ” the lawsuit said. Ms. Lee had agreed before her death in 2016 to allow Mr. Rudin and Mr. Sorkin to develop a new stage adaptation of the novel. But the executor of her estate  Tonja B. Carter  objected in a lawsuit of her own last month  filed in Ms. Lee’s home state of Alabama  that the script had deviated too much from the novel. The new lawsuit from Mr. Rudin’s production company  Rudinplay  significantly escalates the dispute as it questions the conduct  qualifications and motivations of Ms. Carter. Ms. Carter’s lawyer  Matthew H. Lembke  rejected the new complaint as “full of wild and baseless allegations that seem only meant to distract from the real issue — whether Rudinplay has violated its written contractual promise that it would not alter the characters in Harper Lee’s classic novel  ‘To Kill a Mockingbird’.” Ms. Carter has taken particular issue with Mr. Sorkin’s depiction of Atticus as a morally ambiguous figure who gradually comes to hold more enlightened views about racial equality  she objected to multiple other elements of the script  but omitted many of those objections in an amended complaint. Mr. Rudin  who is co-producing the play with Lincoln Center Theater  has insisted the play is faithful to the novel. His lawsuit states that “the character of Atticus in the draft script remained noble and idealistic  and true to the character as he appeared in ‘To Kill a Mockingbird.’” But the complaint also argues that Mr. Sorkin is a leading writer with a unique voice and “his participation as playwright would hardly be necessary  or appropriate  if the Play were to be a mere transcription of the Novel.” Mr. Rudin seeks to have the Alabama lawsuit dismissed. He is also asking for the New York court to declare that the play does not violate his agreement with Ms. Lee and that Ms. Carter does not have the authority to act on behalf of Ms. Lee’s estate. He is demanding that the estate award him damages “in no event less than $10 million.” “The Agreement did not give Ms. Lee approval rights over the script of the Play  much less did it give her a right to purport to edit individual lines of dialogue ” he argued in the lawsuit. “It certainly did not give such rights to Ms. Carter  who is not an author  editor  literary agent or critic  and has no known expertise whatsoever in theater or writing.” None In a statement Monday  Ms. Carter said  “As the personal representative of the Estate of Nelle Harper Lee  I must protect the integrity of her beloved American classic  and therefore had no choice but to file a lawsuit against Rudinplay for failing to honor its contract with Ms. Lee. It is my duty and privilege to defend the terms of Ms. Lee’s agreement with Rudinplay  and I am determined to do so.” But  in his lawsuit  Mr. Rudin questioned Ms. Carter’s status as a representative of Ms. Lee’s will and for the first time accused Ms. Carter of having an ulterior motive in challenging the play: a desire to force the cancellation of the Broadway production because of a separate dispute between Ms. Lee’s estate and the heirs of Gregory Peck  who played Atticus Finch in the movie adaptation  over stage rights. While a local theater group in Ms. Lee’s hometown Monroeville  Ala.  has staged a production based on the novel annually for nearly three decades  there has never been a Broadway adaptation of “Mockingbird ” one of the most beloved novels in American literature. In the lawsuit  Mr. Rudin suggests he already intends to postpone the new production  writing that the legal dispute “has rendered it impossible for the play to premiere as scheduled in December  2018  and unless this dispute is resolved in the immediate future  the play will be canceled.” In an interview  Mr. Rudin said he was willing to take the unusual step of performing the play in a courtroom so a jury could determine whether or not the production is true to the spirit of the novel. “A play and a book are two different things. A book is meant to be read  a play is meant to be performed ” he said. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies

He was 71. Sheila Gordon  his former wife  said the cause was complications of renal failure. His only immediate survivor was his brother Norman. Professor Gordon  who taught at New York University and then the University of California  Berkeley  indulged a medley of singular enthusiasms. None At his death Professor Gordon was finishing books about American fascist love cults and women from the 1920s known as flappers. “He was on fire all the time with an insatiable curiosity ” Ms. Gordon  also a former student of his  said in a telephone interview. None None The book includes a catalog of 100 Grand Guignol plots divided by themes like infanticide  helplessness  surgery  suicide and sex farce. None Professor Gordon wrote as an eager scholarly guide to carnal  unorthodox cultures that he was too young to have indulged in. Following his study of the Grand Guignol  he explored the sexualized worlds of two European cities in the copiously illustrated “Voluptuous Panic: The Erotic World of Weimar Berlin” (2000) and “Horizontal Collaboration: The Erotic World of Paris  1920-1946). “For centuries ” he wrote in “Horizontal Collaboration ” “the French capital has been the erotic lodestone for lust-smitten ramblers. No regime changes  riots  violent revolutions  wars or foreign invasions have sullied its exalted urban status. Jaded and love-wary nomads from every nation have sought out Paris’s tawdry offerings and singular institutions of pleasure.” Feral House  which specializes in odd subjects  published many of Professor Gordon’s books  including “Erik Jan Hanussen: Hitler’s Jewish Clairvoyant” (2001)  about a psychic who had a brief alliance with Hitler. None Melvin Irwin Gordon was born on Feb. 18  1947  in Detroit. He said that his left-wing parents — his father  Joseph  was a salesman  his mother  the former Rose Alpert  was an interviewer for a market research firm — inspired his free thinking. After graduating from the University of Michigan with a bachelor’s degree  he earned a master’s at N.Y.U. and a Ph.D. there in performance studies. Professor Gordon taught at N.Y.U. from 1975 to 1989. He also taught acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute and the Michael Chekhov Acting Studio in Manhattan. He was hired by Berkeley in 1990 as a professor in what is now the department of theater  dance and performance studies. His class on bad acting  Ms. Gordon said  was one of his most popular. None In addition to teaching  Professor Gordon created and directed shows in San Francisco  including “The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber” (1994)  about a scandalous dancer  actress and writer during the Weimar Republic years  between the world wars. None “I go up to her and ask her  ‘What are you thinking about when you’re stripping?’ ” he said. “And she says  ‘How much I hate my father.’ I said  ‘You’re hired!’ ” The San Francisco Chronicle called “The Seven Addictions” a “messy  lewd  extravagant evening but one with a whiff of magic about it.” Professor Gordon subsequently wrote a book about Ms. Berber  published in 2006. He followed the same course with Hanussen  Hitler’s clairvoyant  staging a show about him then writing his biography. None His forthcoming study of fascist love cults from 1922 to 1942 is typical of his work  Mr. Parfrey said. “You hear about various aspects of fascism in the United States  but the cults he’s writing about — some of them in the Bay Area — are fascinating because their belief systems are so bizarre and extraordinary ” he said. “It wasn’t hard for Mel to engage me with something that unusual.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/arts/music/review-john-luther-adams-become-desert-seattle-symphony.html,Review: A Pulitzer Sequel for Orchestra  Packed With Drama in Microcosm Advertisement Supported by None SEATTLE — Stress over sequels isn’t just for Hollywood moguls. Contemporary classical heavyweights can feel it  too. None None None Managing expectations made some sense. But it was also unnecessary. While “Become Desert” doesn’t have the easily graspable transitions of its predecessor  it is packed with moments of drama in microcosm. Over a nearly 40-minute span  those slight twists combine to create a new route toward a grand impact. Precisely because the two are so distinct in method  “Desert” came across as a thoroughly worthy successor to “Ocean.” In the new work Mr. Adams divides a large orchestra and a 32-member chorus into five groups. Playing at different tempos — though none of them fast — these discrete ensembles are meant to surround the audience. In Benaroya Hall here  the singers were stationed high up  toward the rear of the space. Tubular chimes were visible two levels up from the orchestra seats  along both sides. Strings  winds and percussion instruments were congregated on the stage. This separation of sonic landscapes brought out Mr. Adams’s gift for orchestration. After an opening section coasted for a bit on a meditative air  courtesy of pinging bells and hissing high strings  the soft-grained entrance of trumpets signaled a change  without overhauling the moderate  peaceable dynamics. At the same time  the disparate tempos between the mini-ensembles kept this from feeling like an easy-listening exercise. Chiming sounds were omnipresent throughout. But they rarely struck in alignment. Occasionally Mr. Adams used these not-quite-unison passages to cover his tracks. At one moment  the soprano voices were layered in a heavenly harmony. But after a brief  scattered system of pitched percussion passed  those voices suddenly sounded forlorn. The transition to these new tones had been masked  so the tragic-hued change came as a gentle surprise  all the more effective for having being delivered without any obvious  stentorian announcement. A vast expanse of heartbreak was surveyed in mere seconds  from the vantage of a vessel that barely had to hum to switch gears. Mr. Morlot’s affection for the work’s expressive richness came through clearly. Though the piece doesn’t advertise its complexity  it’s easy to imagine a performance of such airily arranged music seeming scattered or listless. The Seattle Symphony never sounded at a loss  though. The audience allowed the piece’s concluding return toward spareness to ring out fully before charging in with enthusiastic applause. None Most weeks  Mr. Denk’s appearance would have been the headline news. But on Thursday  it effortlessly shared the stage with “Become Desert”: two excellent performances of two gripping pieces of music. The casual way the Seattle Symphony presented a major premiere along with a notable guest star in a repertory staple suggested an orchestra working confidently  moving from strength to strength.

A fifth character  John  a classmate of Hiro’s  is also confronting the issue of mortality and he is anxious about the legacy he will leave behind. Ms. Nanako Winkler said that the play’s characters are meant to challenge stereotypes about Asian-Americans and Kentucky residents. Of the mother character  Masako  she said  “I wanted to sort of dismantle the myth of the submissive Asian mother as well as the tiger mom Asian mother.” The characterization of John was motivated by a similar desire  she said: “I really wanted to create a smart  funny  dynamic  liberal character that lives in Kentucky  because you don’t see that often.” None None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/crosswords/daily-puzzle-2018-02-25.html,Letter Recycling Advertisement Supported by Wordplay None None None Fortunately  cogitation is a low-waste activity. Today  Will Nediger brings us a puzzle that takes ingenious advantage of its ingredients and leaves nothing to discard. None None Mr. Nediger  of course  uses much more complex and interesting examples of this genre  and he adds a twist. There are six examples in this grid  each consists of two crossing words  one of which provides the “bank” for the other  and they’re clued the same. Depending on where you first completed a theme entry  you might get this immediately. My first solve was the classic New York entry in the southeast corner  clued with “Bagel topping”: SCHMEAR (the bank  at 89D) and CREAM CHEESE (the across “withdrawal”  at 111A). This one was apparent enough that  combining it with the title of the puzzle  I figured out the device without actually knowing what a “letter bank” was. However  a few of the other entries are much more subtle. If you solved the pair at 95A and 39D  both for “Really impressive ” you’d have ASTOUNDING and OUTSTANDING  which are one letter (a repeat T) away from being anagrams. If you started out with the northeast pair of “Revolutionary War heroes” at 28A and 13D  you could be really confused — NATHAN HALE and ETHAN ALLEN aren’t anagrams  but they’ve got the same number of letters in their names — and the same letters  which satisfies the rules of the letter bank game. I was a bit astounded myself when I grasped the intricacies here  it seemed to me that there must be an extraordinary number of options for a constructor once you settled into a theme like this  and really finding the great ones would be infinitely time-consuming. I then looked at the notes and Mr. Nediger  you guessed it  used code to make it possible. I get it  gone are the days of a big dictionary  a pencil and some graph paper  but it’s a big responsibility to not let the machine surpass the artist. We need to learn a lesson from this dog (the furry one). There was a decent allotment of classic fill in today’s puzzle  not that that’s a bad thing. I count on names like CHAN  CHER  IBSEN  OSSIE and ANAIS to start in confidently on a Sunday puzzle  as well as some words like ARETE  ODEA and ID EST that show up in grids far more often than they do in the rest of my life. There were plenty of other clues that I found ticklish and/or tough. None None None None None None 28D: I never would have recognized this entry from the clue  which strikes me as a little meanspirited  but maybe that’s because I keep hearing NAILED IT (!) on TV this week as praise for people that  frankly  seem to be able to fly. I guess if the arrogant guy in your romcom slips on a banana peel this is an O.K. term to use sarcastically. None Will liked my first submission  but there was one pair that didn’t fit with the rest — SILENT K and TELEKINESIS  which I had clued along the lines of [Something a Jedi knight has]. That clue involved trickery  unlike the rest  so he had me replace it. Easier said than done to find a pair that would fit in that exact spot  but eventually I found a replacement. Anyway  I’ve gone on for a lot longer than I usually do  but that’s because a ton of time went into this theme! I’ll just leave readers with a few pairs which didn’t quite work for the theme  but which I enjoyed coming across anyway: COASTAL ELITES / SOCIALIST STATE APPASSIONATA / PIANO SONATA FORNICATING / GRATIFICATION NATALIE PORTMAN / EMPEROR PALPATINE FOOT FETISH / IF THE SHOE FITS IT AIN’T OVER TILL IT’S OVER / IT’S NEVER TOO LATE GASTROINTESTINAL / INTERNAL ORGANS DOPPELGÄNGER / EDGAR ALLAN POE None What did you think?

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/14/arts/television/halt-and-catch-fire-finale.html,How Failure Made ‘Halt and Catch Fire’ Great Advertisement Supported by None None In its first season  the AMC drama was about the personal-computer revolution of the early 1980s. Then it was about gaming and how the P.C. went from being a tool to an aspect of culture. Then it was about the social internet and online community. Then it was about the growth and commercialization of the World Wide Web in the mid 1990s. But above all  “Halt and Catch Fire” was about failure. Which was part of what made the show a triumph. In the Silicon Valley whose emergence the show chronicles  “fail fast  fail often” has become a glib entrepreneurial mantra. “Halt and Catch Fire” was more interested in failure as a condition of human growth. In its eyes  failure — chafing against limits — is painful and necessary. It can even be  the series suggested  a form of art. In the show’s final season  Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis)  a genius programmer who’s slightly too far ahead of her time  finished an adventure video game  “Pilgrim.” A critical magazine review destroyed it: the game was frustratingly hard  almost antagonistic. Unlike “Doom” and “Mortal Kombat ” with their quick  bloody gratification  “Pilgrim” was enigmatic and difficult. Failure was a feature  not a bug. That’s a tough sell  though  not only in gaming but in television  which may be one reason “Halt” never got the audience it deserved. Failure is an unusual subject for TV dramas  even dark or bittersweet ones. Don Draper of “Mad Men” nearly always got an ad inspiration when he needed one  Tony vanquished his enemies in “The Sopranos”  Coach Taylor’s teams won championships in “Friday Night Lights.” None None Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace)  a mystery man from back East  arrived in Texas with a scheme to maneuver a small electronics company into manufacturing an IBM PC rip off. The plan eventually drew in Cameron  as well as Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy)  an engineer whose dreams were crushed years before with the unsuccessful launch of a computer he designed with his wife  Donna (Kerry Bishé). The get-rich-quick scheme didn’t pan out  but the coup de grâce came when Joe witnessed an unveiling of Apple’s Macintosh  whose graphic interface immediately made the IBM clone seem like a crude stone ax. His failure was not only of business but of imagination. The future was images  media  the ability to connect  and what ordinary people would do with it. That emphasis shifted with the second season and  rewardingly  the character focus shifted with it. Donna and Cameron launched an online gaming company  Mutiny  in the process discovering — as they noticed the service’s chat rooms buzzing with activity — that Mutiny’s real product was community. None Part of the richness of “Halt” came from how it developed a quartet of central characters  each of whom has a distinct dynamic with each of the others. The series began with Joe chafing against Gordon. There were romantic relationships: Joe and Cameron  off and on (finally off)  Gordon and Donna’s marriage and amicable divorce. New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December. Ultimately the series centered on the work marriage — and work divorce — of Donna and Cameron. But the secondary connections were well-developed too: Gordon and Cameron  for instance  devout nerds who unwound together over video games. (Cameron even confessed to Gordon that  as much as she looked down on “Doom” and its carnage  “There’s something cathartic about it.”) These characters were never more themselves than when geeking out  digging into the guts of machines. I’ve never seen a TV series convey as well as “Halt” did the pleasure of making a thing work. When the show killed off Gordon this last season (a breathtakingly executed passing reminiscent of the final run of “Six Feet Under”)  it gave him a final victory fit for an engineer: repairing the office air conditioner with his own hands. Problem solving was the means through which these characters expressed themselves and admired one another’s minds. Donna and Cameron were estranged for most of the final series  but they connected through “Pilgrim”  Donna got a copy  wrestled raptly with it and managed to figure it out. Ms. Bishé  a wonderfully expressive actress  showed without words that Donna was really connecting with her lost friend. None But in its final season  “Halt” managed to convey a sincere nostalgia for the optimism of the early Web. Those crappy early HTML pages  with their corny cartoons and lists of links  were doors leading to endless other doors. It’s the kind of magic that appeals to a teenager looking to discover the world and herself  which is where “Halt” found its final-season throughline. Gordon and Joe founded Comet  a web-portal company inspired by Gordon and Donna’s daughter Haley (Susanna Skaggs)  who’d built a page of links she’d assembled herself. Their proto-Yahoo lost out to the actual Yahoo  which secured a key placement with the Web browser Netscape. (“Halt and Catch Fire” will surely be the only drama ever to convey a climactic plot turn with a slow camera push-in on a browser toolbar.) But the project gave Haley — a misfit at school coming to realize she was gay — a purpose  a peer group and an identity. Failure  from this show’s perspective  is not the end  it’s how people level up. Late in the finale  Donna and Cameron met to reminisce  as Cameron was getting ready to leave town for a fresh start. They talked about working together again someday. Then the conversation shifted  and they began talking about their hypothetical company — “Phoenix”— in the past tense. They traded lines  recounting Phoenix’s story  which was a lot like Mutiny’s: they started small  went public  partnered with a bigger firm  overextended  fought with each other and finally watched their company die. “But ” Cameron said  “it didn’t destroy us this time.” As they spoke  a neon “Phoenix” sign flickered to light on the wall behind them  then winked out. It was a remarkably staged scene  unusually theater-like for a series that operates in the language of cinematic realism. But it felt true to the moment — Donna and Cameron rediscovering their joy in each other’s imagination. The final episode brought each characters to closure. Gordon  through a tape recording he made to calm himself down  spoke to Haley: “Feeling weird is how you know you’re still here.” The group’s mentor  John Bosworth (Toby Huss) eased into his golden years. And Joe  echoing his first appearance in the pilot  addressed a humanities class with the same words — “Let me start by asking a question” — but less arrogance. But for me  the true ending of “Halt and Catch Fire” came one scene earlier  as Donna prepared to see Cameron off over breakfast at a diner. As Donna waited to pay the bill and then  in a sequence beautifully composed by the director  Karyn Kusama  something struck her. She rushed out to the parking lot  found Cameron and — a moment as swoon-worthy as any last-minute declaration of love in a romcom — said those four little words: “I have an idea.” I love that we never find out what the idea is. It’s not the point. The point is the inspiration  the work  the act of creation. The idea will be whatever it is. It’ll probably end up a failure. It’ll be great.

Technically speaking  a EWER is not a “Ceremonial basin” anyway (although a EWER could be part of the set  holding water to be poured over the hands)  but I could not dredge up the word LAVABO to save my life. And yet  LAVABO opens today’s puzzle by Andrew Kingsley. So I did what I always do when I’m stuck: I bopped around the puzzle  filling in what I could and hoping that some of it would eventually cross. There were a few gimmes  I dropped in ROMCOM first  followed by ESTÉE  because I am no longer fooled by “First name in ___” clues  and the “First name in foundations” refers to the makeup mogul ESTÉE Lauder. Did you skip confidently past the question mark in “Picture frame?” and fill in CEL? Or how about the Scottish name for “John ” which is IAN? You knew that. You just have to find that clue you know and get that word into the grid. So  I was stuck on LAVABO  and ORLE crossing at the end didn’t help things any  but that’s Friday for you. I appreciated EDITOR’S NOTE and SATELLITE TV  which was surprising because of the letter V at the end of the entry. PRIZE INSIDE and HERE’S HOPING  the seed entries  were delicious  and I got those by solving the short crossing entries until the long Acrosses came into focus. Over all  I would have preferred fewer words and more longer entries  but this was a nice change of pace. I liked AT THIS RATE  GAME FACE  BAD MOOD (which makes its New York Times Crossword debut today)  CEASE-FIRES and the wonderful HAS DIBS. ■ 13A: Wordplay alert! “One may open an issue” is not referring to the kind of issues you might bring up to  say  a customer service representative. It’s referring to an issue of a magazine  which usually begins with an EDITOR’S NOTE. ■ 19A: You know  I don’t believe I’ve ever looked at SPANDEX this way. It got its name from a feature of the material  which is that it “expands.” You can get a lot of mileage out of anagrams if you know what you’re doing. ■ 36A: Hands up if you were thinking of a baseball dugout. Me too. A canoe is carved out of wood  and where you sit is the “dug out” part  so CANOED is a perfectly cromulent clue for “Sat in a dugout?” ■ 54D: “Oz. sextet” seems  on the surface  like it might be about Australia  doesn’t it? Not today. Today  “Oz.” refers to ounces  and there are six TSPS in an ounce. None I think I’m happiest with the clues on this one for two reasons. First  I love the fun facts  particularly for SPANDEX  ANT and SIXTIES. Second  most of the Across clues are my own. When I first started constructing  I was such a grid hound that I gave little time to the clues in attempt to submit as many puzzles as quickly as possible. As a nascent constructor raised on a diet of crossword blogs  I picked up their entry fetish  where their writing focused only on the hottest words in the themeless grid while overlooking the creative pop of the clever clues  which could make blander entries like CEASE-FIRES or CEL come alive. While a puzzle needs its lifeblood of OSCAR NODs and GAME FACEs  I discovered that my early philosophy was fairly myopic. I await the day when a themeless is filled with purposely banal entries  yet the clues are the prize  and by themselves make the puzzle sexy. Here’s hoping. Your thoughts?

Helen Fielding’s 1996 novel  “Bridget Jones’s Diary ” showed that it was possible to lift Austen’s story line and create a funny contemporary novel about a spirited young woman in search of love  while reminding us that “Pride and Prejudice” was one of the original screwball comedy/romcom templates. “Eligible ” by the best-selling novelist Curtis Sittenfeld  is a “modern retelling” of “Pride and Prejudice ” commissioned by the Austen Project  which has been pairing contemporary authors with various Austen works. The novel is largely set in Cincinnati and stars Liz Bennet  her four sisters  their social-climbing mother and self-absorbed father  and the sisters’ assorted suitors. None It has the passive-aggressive Liz Bennet proposing to Darcy that they have “hate sex ” and her sister Jane falling in love with Chip Bingley  who is the star of a reality show called “Eligible” (think “The Bachelor”). Much to their bigoted mother’s dismay  their younger sister Lydia elopes with a transgender man  and another sister  Kitty  begins dating the black real estate agent who is selling their house. Throughout the novel  Ms. Sittenfeld struggles to update the plot of “Pride and Prejudice ” failing to find the effortless sorts of analogies Ms. Heckerling deftly used in “Clueless.” She also fails to work the sort of entertaining improvisations on her material that Ms. Fielding did in “Bridget Jones.” As a result  she italicizes the differences between women’s roles in the early 19th century and their place in society today — instead of underscoring the eternal emotional dynamics between men and women  which make Austen’s work so timeless. In a labored attempt to make the matter of marriage more of an issue  Ms. Sittenfeld has aged Liz and Jane  putting them on the cusp of turning 40  and concocted money problems for their parents that put financial issues on everyone’s mind. At the same time  she places nearly as much emphasis on the Bennet sisters’ marital prospects (particularly with wealthy men) as their venal mother and the show “Eligible” do. The men Liz and Jane fall for — that is  Darcy and Bingley — are described more in terms of their scintillating looks  impressive wealth and Ivy League credentials than in terms of their humor  smarts or charm. They are almost caricatures of what social-climbing mothers like Mrs. Bennet want for their daughters: rich  good-looking doctors from good families. Ms. Sittenfeld has somehow managed to turn Darcy  one of literature’s great heartthrobs  into a dimwitted  tongue-tied fellow  smitten with Liz even when she is at her most insolent. And Bingley emerges as a sentimental fool  given to crying fits: The “gush from his eyes would surely have been sufficient to bathe a medium-sized dog: a corgi or  perhaps  a Border collie.” Most of the Bennet sisters have “nonlucrative careers” and an obsession with exercise. Jane is a yoga instructor — a job that doesn’t cover her rent in Manhattan. Liz is a writer at large for a woman’s magazine called Mascara and runs 25 miles a week. And Kitty and Lydia  who have “never worked longer than a few months at a time  as desultory nannies or salesgirls” at the local Abercrombie & Fitch or the Banana Republic  are CrossFit addicts who have “a derisive attitude toward the weak and unenlightened masses who still believed that jogging was a sufficient workout and a bagel was an acceptable breakfast.” The fifth Bennet sister  Mary  is an antisocial oddball  who is pursuing her third online master’s degree. It’s not just that many of Ms. Sittenfeld’s characters often seem more like the Kardashians (if the Kardashians lived in Cincinnati) than Austen heroines  but that the entire tone of this novel feels off: The layered satire and irony in “Pride and Prejudice” have been replaced here with high-decibel mockery  just as Austen’s sense of irony has been supplanted by sophomoric jokes. What the younger Bennet sisters think of as wit is vulgar bathroom humor  shouting out guesses during a charades game like “Exploding with diarrhea!” and “Hemorrhoids!” that have little to do with the clues. And while Liz likes to think she has better manners  she makes a crude masturbation joke  when she finally has a chance to talk with Darcy alone  after months of confusion and estrangement. As for Jane  “the sweet yogini ” she has no problem agreeing to appear on an embarrassing reality show — including interviews about her “journey” as a single woman  and a bachelorette party featuring male strippers dressed as cops and firefighters — that will translate the intimate details of her relationship with Bingley into television ratings. In return  her family members will get paid some $30 000 each. The other Jane — Jane Austen — would not have been amused. None Eligible By Curtis Sittenfeld 492 pages. Random House. $28.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/books/review/hollywood-stanley-kubrick-and-me-and-more.html,Hollywood: ‘Stanley Kubrick and Me ’ and More Advertisement Supported by Roundup None None Tell me something I don’t know or let me get back to rereading William Goldman’s “Adventures in the Screen Trade ” where nobody pretends to know anything. None More dubious still  D’Alessandro (who moved back to Italy with his wife after Kubrick’s death in 1999) readily admits that he is not a writer. So he sought out Filippo Ulivieri  a younger teacher of film theory and Italy’s leading Kubrick expert  to develop a viable “Emilio” voice and turn his stories into a coherent book. Then that Italian voice was given an English translation by Simon Marsh. (The Italian edition was published in 2012  a 2015 ­Italian-British documentary  “S Is for Stanley ” makes use of the same material.) Oh no  I thought  not Little Guy Feeds Big Guy’s Kittens  translated from the Italian. Yet here I am  embodying Goldman’s famous “Screen Trade” dictum  not knowing anything. Because “Stanley Kubrick and Me” turns out to be a weird  revealing delight. Yes  D’Alessandro did  at times  see to the welfare of his boss’s welter of coddled cats. He also drove Kubrick’s cars  counseled his children and  one late night  fended off a plea to return to his boss’s house to empty out a vacuum cleaner bag because Mr. Big could not find his wedding ring. But the accretion of details about this seemingly salt-of-the-earth working stiff and the eccentric artistic genius who paid him creates an irresistible picture of friendship  loyalty and artistic temperament. The stuff D’Alessandro was asked to do was sometimes really nuts  and maybe the employee was nuts for putting up with his employer’s whims. (There is no hiding his wife’s displeasure at her husband’s absences when their own two children were young  or at his willingness to leap  at all hours  at Kubrick’s call.) And heaven knows the crazy stuff Kubrick demanded of Emilio — and of the entire staff — was the product of world-class self-­absorption and a maddening obliviousness to the lives of others. Well  all of that is here. And I enjoyed every word  along with Kubrick’s bonus advice about haberdashery. “Stanley had been very clear about shirts: I was to use only shirts with two breast pockets. . . . The pockets had to be button-down so that nothing would fall out if I bent over.” None Gabler’s organizing principle is that Streisand’s outsider roots — as a Jewish-looking  Jewish-sounding  ­Brooklyn-toughened woman who pushed past rejection and (gentile) Hollywood standards of female beauty and desirability to brilliant stardom — are the defining  revolutionary characteristic of her life. The observation isn’t itself revolutionary  who would disagree? But the author does a neat job of weaving every thread he can pull into the cloth. In her otherness  “she was the Joe Louis of Jews and gays  their knockout puncher  not only the one performer with whom they could identify but the performer whose triumph became their triumph.” He sees Jewishness in her liberal politics  and in her feminism  which  he muses  may be “another part of her Jewish heritage where women were often characterized as tough and domineering.” He even reads code into her romance with the hairdresser-turned-producer Jon Peters  noting  “The man-killing Streisand of the Jewish Woman syndrome had . . . become positively kittenish with ­Peters.” Gabler squeezes a lot of best-yeshiva-student scholarly references and citations into his assignment. And the editorial decision to title each chapter with a Yiddishism goes a shtick too far. But at least this brief biography looks at a well-documented star in a new way. None None With no context  though  the title comes off as a complaint on the part of the author  who seems to dislike his subject for reasons unintelligible to his readers beyond the fact that she is Meryl Streep  and she is generally considered to be one of the most illustrious American actors of her generation: still working  still transforming herself physically  still winning prizes. Irked  the author sets out to discover why she’s still here. But  as he is an unauthorized biographer  Schulman’s direct access to those who know Streep best is spotty. And as a result  the reminiscences of a former high school boyfriend receive an inordinate amount of weight  and the author leans heavily on published interviews and articles by others to come up with a leapfrogging “explanation” of how the New Jersey high school cheerleader Mary Louise Streep became the award-laden actor she is. The path Schulman charts hops from Vassar to the Yale School of Drama to the Public Theater to Streep’s romance with the actor John Cazale to “The Deer Hunter” to “Kramer vs. Kramer.” And there the book ends  although not before a long  juicy  publicity-generating telling of on-set strife between Streep and Dustin Hoffman at a time when Streep was still grieving over Cazale’s death. “She had never believed that actors had to suffer ” Schulman says. “With almost alien precision  she could simulate any emotion she needed to. But if Meryl was now an emotional wreck playing an emotional wreck  could anyone (including her) really say whether she was faking it? Could she be ‘real’ and a simulacrum at the exact same time?” None This may be Freeman’s cue to smack me down with an Ally Sheedy quote from “The Breakfast Club”: “When you grow up  your heart dies.” Fair enough! Now in her late 30s  Freeman is New York-bred but long based in London  where she writes a lively column for The Guardian and contributes bright pieces to British Vogue  she won me over some years ago with “The Meaning of Sunglasses ” her cheeky book about style and fashion  and she followed that with “Be Awesome: Modern Life for Modern Ladies.” She specializes in wry  bouncy  lady-to-lady declarations for Gen Y-ers on down  a rhetorical swagger spawned by the swell feminist website Jezebel that assumes readers understand the jokey appropriation of the fuddy-duddy word “lady” in the first place. None None Still  mixed in with the slumber-party gush  Freeman makes many smart observations worth saving up and revisiting for a project less giggly than this: She notes that “girls in ’80s teen movies love sex  and suffer few consequences for it.” Her comments on male friendships in “Ghostbusters” are astute. And in her riff on “Steel Magnolias” — into which she loops “Nine to Five ” “Terms of Endearment” and “Beaches” — she touches on an idea about which this snooty critic would like to read more. “What I love about classic women’s movies ” Freeman writes with ease and clarity  “is that they tell women that their daily lives are interesting.” None Geltzer  an entertainment lawyer  begins with the shocked public reaction to “The Kiss ” a 47-second featurette produced by the Edison Manufacturing Company in 1896 that caused one contemporary snooty critic to declare  “The spectacle of the prolonged pasturing on each other’s lips was hard to bear.” Thorough and low-key in his handling of hot stuff as varied as boxing movies  Jane Russell’s breasts  nudie flicks  “I Am Curious (Yellow) ” “Carnal Knowledge ” “Boys in the Sand ” “Debbie Does Dallas” and the number of times a particular four-letter word is spoken in “The Wolf of Wall Street” (for those counting at home  it’s 506 times over 180 minutes  or one every 21 seconds)  the author is also crisp in his explanation of changing legal boundaries over the decades. And not without an eye for attention-getting citations from primary sources. Best of all  thanks to Geltzer  readers can savor the otherwise forgotten disapproving review of a Baltimore judge who didn’t care for Howard Hughes’s baroque 1943 western “The Outlaw”: “Jane Russell’s breasts hung over the picture like a summer thunderstorm spread out over a landscape.” Those again.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/07/arts/07reuters-filmfestival-cannes-gilliam.html,"Paris Court Keeps Filmmaker Gilliam in Suspense Over Quixote Movie Advertisement Supported by None PARIS — British filmmaker Terry Gilliam will have to wait until Wednesday to learn if the Don Quixote movie he has spent two decades struggling to make will be allowed to screen at the Cannes Film Festival  which opens this week. A Paris court on Monday heard a lawsuit to ban the screening  brought by a producer who says he has rights over ""The Man who Killed Don Quixote"". The court said it would deliver its verdict on Wednesday afternoon. That extends the agony for Gilliam  the former Monty Python member whose quest to make the film has been plagued by misfortune. An initial version  starring Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis  was abandoned in 2000. The movie is due to close the Cannes Film Festival  which starts on Tuesday  screening after the awards ceremony on May 19. But that depends on the court ruling. Gilliam's lawyer said he was hopeful the injunction would be denied. ""We demonstrated that this prejudice is a figment of their imagination "" Benjamin Sarfati told reporters outside the courthouse. ""...It's time for the film to be seen. It is Terry Gilliam’s most powerful desire that the film can meet with its audience."" Paulo Branco  who brought the lawsuit  said: ""The conflict with Terry Gilliam is something much deeper than what has been said today  that it is simply an issue of money. It is not that.""

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/books/review/suspense-child-finder-rene-denfeld.html,Missing Persons and Messed-Up Shrinks: 4 New Suspense Novels Advertisement Supported by The Shortlist None None Denfeld is a Portland-based journalist and private investigator  and also the adoptive mother of three foster children. All these aspects of her life are mined in “The Child Finder ” a powerful novel about a search for a missing girl that’s also a search for identity. Naomi  a private investigator in the chilly Pacific Northwest  specializes in missing children. And she’s harboring a secret: She was once a missing child herself. Her latest case involves a high-spirited 5-year-old named Madison Culver  who vanished during a family trip to find a Christmas tree. Three years later  Naomi picks up the trail  taking her deep into the forbidding woods of rural Oregon. Everything — and everyone — is cold and isolated  the snow blanketing the evil just beneath the surface. It’s “Deliverance” encased in ice. While Denfeld’s novel is indeed loaded with suspense  its resonance comes from its surprising tilt toward storytelling restraint  a rarity in this typically crackling genre. Elegiac  informative and disquieting  it artfully moves between Naomi’s painstaking search  which triggers scattershot memories of her own disappearance  and the survival tactics of plucky Madison  who  in coping with her brutal captivity  has reimagined herself as “the snow girl ” a character from a fairy tale. Denfeld adroitly divebombs up  down and around her main characters’ experience of secrets  resilience  fantasy and death  all set in a dark  gloomy forest fit for the Brothers Grimm. The novel gallops to a suitably heart-racing finish as Naomi tries to outrun the clock to save Madison. And  perhaps  herself. None As a real-life Manhattan psychotherapist  Brady would seem the ideal writer to tell the story of a high-flying doctor at a New York City mental hospital who’s secretly battling her own personal demons. Alas  her main character  Dr. Samantha James  is so unlikable  so relentlessly awful  that it’s impossible to care about her. A raging alcoholic  Sam spends the first two-thirds of the book vomiting into her wastebasket  getting beaten up by her abusive prig of a boyfriend and seeking comfort via cheap sex with a narcissistic barfly. Her struggle to keep her star-doctor facade intact  presumably meant to arouse our concern and sympathy  yields anything but. The novel is presented as a psychological chess match pitting Sam against a patient named Richard McHugh  a cipher with a secret agenda. Yet it’s merely a long  dreary slog with a paint-by-numbers supporting cast (the do-goody cheerleader colleague  the clueless boss  the chip-on-his-shoulder guy  the prince of a friend) and spectacularly bad metaphors (“His voice sounds a little bit like what I would imagine a diesel engine covered in melted butter would sound like”). Richard  who has stolen mini-bottles of booze out of Sam’s filing cabinet  begins blackmailing her  in the process rooting out the real cause of her misery as he gradually reveals his own left-field identity. Never has there been a more appropriate title: “The Blind” has no idea where it’s going. None Cara is a wife and mother who  after a nasty marital row  flees her home in England for a spa in Arizona. But upon her arrival she’s sent to a room that’s already occupied — by a man and a young girl. To compensate  the spa upgrades Cara to a villa and all is well  until she begins to suspect that the girl she saw was Melody Chapa  whose parents are currently in prison for her murder. The novel’s intriguing premise — what if Melody is alive? — is sabotaged by Hannah’s choice of a sleuth. Cara  supposedly desperate for privacy and solitude  becomes an amateur detective overnight. And she’s joined in her effort by an ersatz “Scooby-Doo” gang that includes a cranky shrew who’s been “spotting” Melody for years  a Kardashian-like mother and daughter  a jumpy desk clerk and a brassy Nancy Grace type with an agenda of her own. All this necessitates rather too much suspension of disbelief  never more so than at the authorities’ blithe willingness to let Cara proceed with her investigation. Then there’s the problem of pace: The first third of the novel reads like an article for Travel + Leisure  as it seems as if every pillow  curtain and tile is described in vivid detail. We get it: She’s at a fancy spa! In the end  though  the real measure of a good psychological thriller lies in its ability to deliver jaw-dropping twists  and here Hannah succeeds  keeping the shocks coming until the very end. Who’s telling the truth? No one. Who’s lying? Everyone. Including  quite possibly  the girl whose disappearance started it all. None Ella Brooke’s older sister  Miranda  disappeared when Ella was only 20  leaving her newborn child behind. Ten years later  that boy  Luke  begs his aunt to find out what really happened to his mother. Most people believe Miranda was a victim of a seductive  now-jailed serial killer named Jason Thorne. Ella begins to think otherwise. As Ella slowly creeps closer to the truth  Kendal reveals her cards  one tantalizing flip at a time. Just when you think you know where the story’s going  you’re jolted sideways. A wild matrix of secrets  betrayals  vendettas  jealousies and hidden motives is revealed  as no one seems to be who they say they are. (Is he acting fishy? Is he? Or is … she?) After Ella uncovers what really befell Miranda  Kendal boxes her heroine into a corner so tight you can’t fathom how she’s ever going to get her out. It’s marvelously tension-filled storytelling. Kendal misses a prime opportunity to take advantage of her setting  the English countryside near Bath  there are too many red herrings  and the ending is a bit too tidy. Nonetheless  “The Second Sister” is a psycho-thrilling romp  with Ella mentally talking to Miranda every step of the way — and Miranda answering back. It turns out sisters really do speak their own language. And it’s one that’s worth hearing.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/books/review/ruth-ware-the-lying-game-guilt-suspense.html,Suspense Fiction That Mines the Terrain of Female Guilt Advertisement Supported by The Shortlist None None Pretty  clever  restless and ethically blank  Natalie hits on a scheme to pilfer from the customers of NuLine Telecommunications  where she registers payments behind a “frosted partition.” All she needs to do is marry someone whose last name starts with a T and she can sign over all the checks made out to “N.T.” to herself. And so Moggach’s marvelously tricky novel embarks on its exploration of this ruse’s many surprising repercussions — for Natalie and others  including the hapless momma’s boy she weds because he has the right initial and the various victims of her seemingly victimless crime. Moggach offers the twists of a proper suspense thriller  but she knows that her job is also to entertain along the way. So she peoples her story with complex characters and witty observations on their cramped  disappointing lives in the industrial English city of Leeds. A sad highlight of Natalie’s previous 32 years was a one-night stand in the ’90s with a rock ’n’ roller who misspelled her name on a morning-after publicity photo. “The guy might be dyslexic ” she shrugged. Now she’s moved on to bigger things  and thrills — to “the buzz of crime  the kick of it. She felt fizzingly alive to her fingertips.” The novel’s sharply drawn characters bring another payoff. While some thrillers tick off a checklist of red herrings on a predictable march to the finish  Moggach’s creations  with their layered personalities and shifting motivations  throw more guesswork into the mix. And something to ponder  too: matters of morality  complicity and fate. None The prologue serves notice that one of two sisters will die in the course of Ellwood’s novel. Beyond that  all is gloom and confusion under the sway of a narrative voice muddled by drink  drugs and post-traumatic stress disorder. Kate Rafter suffers from the effects of all three after a horrifying stint as a war reporter in Syria. She’s returning to her childhood home on the coast of England with enough baggage to fill a beat-up rucksack and at least two or three thrillers. Within a few chapters  Kate undergoes a psychiatric evaluation after harassing a neighbor she suspects of harming a little boy no one else can see. Meanwhile  she ruminates over the wreckage of her life: the demise of a romantic relationship  an unhinged attack on a coworker  the death of her mother  a family history of domestic abuse  a sister’s paralyzing alcoholism  the mysterious long-ago drowning of a baby brother. And then there’s the suspicion that something creepy is going on in the garden shed next door. Unless Kate’s imagining it. The only certainty is that everything can’t possibly be as it seems. “I am on the edge of it all ” Kate concludes  “a ghost with no foundations  no roots.” While Ellwood serves up some action  most of the revelations emerge from memories that eventually crystalize amid the fog. They proceed from an intriguing central motif: that PTSD can render a narrator unreliable and deliver the confusion necessary to tangle a plot. None Ephron’s mystery is surprisingly gentle  considering the potentially disturbing subject matter at its core. A 4-year-old girl vanished 40 years ago from a town on the South Carolina coast. Three generations of women unite to search for her when a clue resurfaces — a damaged porcelain doll  possibly one that had been handcrafted as a portrait of the child and went missing along with her. Miss Sorel  the girl’s mother  is the master crafter who made the original doll. Now her elder daughter  Lis  and granddaughter  Vanessa  join her to sort through leads while tending the layers of guilt and sorrow that burden their family. The setting promises some Southern gothic atmosphere — Ephron describes the odor along the Bonsecours River  “thick with the pungent  slick  gooey pluff mud that was exposed by a receding tide” — but there’s little sense of menace or imminent danger. Fans of zingier thrillers might wish the big moments in this one popped with more drama. A ceramic kiln for dollmaking explodes  but we learn about it second-hand  after the fact. A valuable doll collection disappears when no one is home. Some tires may have been deflated. Ephron aims for readers who favor milder entertainment  leaning toward novels in which the writing is straightforward and the plot spools out at measured pace. The appeal here lies in her portraits of the women  who rely on their doggedness and emotional bonds on a mission to restore the family peace. None A single cryptic text  “I need you ” reunites four friends in the stippled light of an English seaside village just as surely as it signals readers that they’re in the hands of a pro. Ware sets her psychological puzzle in a crumbling old mill on the Reach  where a marshy river meets the glimmering sea. It’s the home of Kate  who summons her old friends Isa  Thea and Fatima when the discovery of a human bone in the shifting sand threatens to reveal misdeeds from their boarding-school days 17 years earlier. Ware further complicates the guessing game with the disclosure that the teenagers once played a game of their own invention  awarding points for telling convincing lies to taunt their classmates. Now the former clique must separate truth from deception as the stakes ratchet higher amid the growing possibility that someone close to them has committed murder. “A lie ” says the narrator  Isa  no slouch at the game. “I’d almost forgotten how they feel on my tongue  slick and sickening.” Capable as she is  Ware hasn’t worked out all the kinks of believability. Would Isa  a hyperprotective new mother  keep returning to the creepy mill with her baby as threats mount  the electricity fails and the sea threatens to swallow any route of escape? But for the most part  “The Lying Game” makes good on its premise that tall tales have consequences  especially when they’re exposed to the glare of truth.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/13/opinion/the-real-suspense-in-kenya.html,The Real Suspense in Kenya Advertisement Supported by Editorial None None None The presidency was one of 1 880 positions Kenya’s 19 million voters were to fill. It was the most closely and nervously monitored race because of the violence following past presidential elections  notably in 2007  when more than 1 300 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced. Since then the Kenyan government has made admirable changes to the Constitution  devolving considerable powers to 47 newly created counties so that the presidential race would not be a winner-take-all affair. But ethnic identity still plays a major role in Kenyan politics  with all but one president since independence  including Jomo Kenyatta  the first president and father of the current one  coming from the Kikuyu tribe  the country’s largest. Both President Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga  a Luo  come from families and networks that have dominated Kenyan politics since independence  and both represent coalitions of ethnic groups. Mr. Odinga has once again fanned the embers of ethnic strife. That is disgraceful and unnecessary. International monitors from the African Union  the United States and Europe said they witnessed no foul play  former United States Secretary of State John Kerry  co-leader of the Carter Center’s mission of election observers  praised Kenya’s election commission for its transparency and diligence. All observers have urged Mr. Odinga and other losing candidates to refer any allegations of fraud to the commission and the courts. None All that can and should be checked. But in the meantime it is imperative that Mr. Odinga strongly urge his followers to remain calm.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/arts/television/law-and-order-menendez-murders-review.html,Review: A ‘Law and Order’ Where ‘Whodunit’ Meets ‘Who Cares’ Advertisement Supported by None In the criminal-entertainment system  ripped-from-the-headlines dramas are represented by two separate groups. For decades  “Law and Order” and its spinoffs made up the first: police procedurals that used real-life crimes as jumping-off points for fictional murder cases. None “Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders” (deep breath) is an attempt to fold this latest trend under the brand that the producer Dick Wolf created. The result is like a fast-food giant competing with Chipotle by chopping up a hamburger and rolling it in a tortilla. It’s got the form  but not the flavor. Many of this year’s best TV shows and movies are available to stream right now. Watching  The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site  can show you where. Tell us what mood you’re in or what services you subscribe to and we’ll help you out. The key to “American Crime Story” was that it was really an American justice story. It delved into the vibrant personalities  the media circus  the racial and celebrity dynamics behind Mr. Simpson’s acquittal. It wasn’t a whodunit. It was a whydoyoucareaboutit. “Menendez ” written by Mr. Wolf’s longtime associate Rene Balcer  also borrows a tabloid murder case — that of Lyle and Erik Menendez (Miles Gaston Villanueva and Gus Halper)  who were convicted in 1996 for the murder of their parents in 1989. But it’s more mechanical and less thoughtful  lacking a larger curiosity. Its first two plodding episodes play like the opening acts of a way-too-extended episode of the original “Law & Order.” The series  beginning Tuesday  opens on a lurid  slow-motion re-creation of the shotgun murder  then shifts into police-procedural mode. (We hear our first chung-chung! sound effect twelve minutes or so in.) This means spending a lot of time with the investigators  Detective Les Zoeller (Sam Jaeger) and Detective Tom Linehan (Cliff Chamberlain) — who are so personality-free my notes distinguish them only as “Mustache” and “No Mustache” — and the brothers  who are sullen question marks. New movies and TV shows are added to streaming platforms each month. Here are the titles we think are most interesting in December. This just-the-facts approach worked well in the original series’s hourlong investigations. In the serial “Menendez ” whose details are readily Googled  there’s no suspense nor vivid characters to make up for it. The potentially interesting part of the story involves Erik’s attorney  Leslie Abramson (Edie Falco)  who must construct a defense for a client she immediately assumes is guilty. But in the attempt to balance the “law” and “order” halves of this series  she’s underdeveloped  with a only few flicks at rounding out her workaholic character. Ms. Falco makes the most of what she has to work with. So do Josh Charles and Heather Graham in a side story about the affair between Erik’s psychologist  Jerome Oziel  and Judalon Smyth  which led to the leak of Erik’s confession in therapy. That subplot at least has some soapy verve  but it feels like it belongs in another  less buttoned-down series. There is the barest germ of an animating idea in “Menendez” — the wealthy buy justice and get automatic benefit of the doubt from the police — but it’s perfunctory and blunt. If you’re not familiar with the Menendez story already  you may wonder why it was ever such a media obsession. The missing spark is underscored in the second episode  with the brief appearance of celebrity defense attorney Robert Shapiro (Douglas Olsson). In “American Crime Story ” John Travolta’s eccentric interpretation resembled the real Mr. Shapiro hardly at all physically  but made his aggrieved vanity unforgettable. This Mr. Shapiro looks a bit more like the real one  but he’s purely functional  there to deliver a line  advance the plot and prompt a fleeting “Hey  it’s that guy!” reaction. Like everyone else in “Menendez ” he’s a courtroom-artist’s sketch who never jumps off the page. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/opinion/nyc-schools-mayoral-control.html,Tired of the Suspense on Mayoral Control of Schools Advertisement Supported by Editorial None Here we are with yet another remake of a movie that wasn’t particularly watchable the first time around: What price will New York State Senate Republicans exact to extend the mayor’s control over New York City’s public schools — and for how long a stretch? With the Legislature hoping to close shop on Wednesday  and the mayor’s present authority expiring June 30  the question is loaded with urgency and anxiety. Little about this remake is new  including the delight that Senate Republicans derive from making Mayor Bill de Blasio squirm  especially on the matter of mayoral control. This is their payback for his “sin” of having tried in 2014  newly in office  to win Democratic control of a chamber that has been in Republican hands for nearly all of the last four decades. That a Democrat would like to see other Democrats triumph hardly comes as a shock  but Mr. de Blasio has paid dearly for the effort. Where his predecessor  Michael Bloomberg  obtained control over education policy in 2002 with a seven-year mandate  followed by one of six years  this mayor has had to scrape by on one-year extensions. It means an annual replay of a familiar — dare we say tiresome — scenario. None This is not a standard left-vs.-right issue. Even conservative critics of Mr. de Blasio say that he  or any mayor  must have control for the sake of stability and efficacy. The merits of tying this to charter schools are hard to discern. Mr. Flanagan could just as readily demand more vegetables in school cafeterias. A real deadline looms: Wednesday night. That’s when lawmakers hope to head home for the rest of the year. Of course  last-minute bargains are hard-wired into Albany’s DNA. The governor  while rarely saddened to see Mr. de Blasio in a tight spot  may yet ride to the rescue with a compromise (the sort of cinematic flourish that appeals to him) before the existing school-governance law expires. The last thing sensible lawmakers should want is to revert to the old system  with policies set by 32 community school districts whose earlier incarnations were distinguished by cronyism and corruption more than by pedagogical excellence. This brinkmanship does no one any good. As the central players roll toward the edge  they risk tumbling over. Just as in a movie that wasn’t watchable in the first place.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/21/opinion/the-suspense-is-almost-too-much-for-the-french.html,The Suspense Is Almost Too Much for the French Advertisement Supported by Editorial Observer None PANTIN  France — “Anyone but Le Pen.” That was the refrain at an open-air market on Wednesday in this banlieue  just northeast of Paris  when I asked people about France’s presidential election on Sunday. Marine Le Pen  the candidate of the far-right National Front  has a good shot at winning first or second place in this first round of voting  which would qualify her for the May 7 runoff. But polls show a tight contest among her and three other candidates  so the people of France wait anxiously to find out who will make it to the final vote. For many in Pantin  a traditional left-wing bastion that is home to many Muslim immigrants  what makes the suspense so excruciating is the tainted lineage of Ms. Le Pen’s party  which her father  Jean-Marie Le Pen  helped found. He has called the holocaust a “detail” of World War II. Though Ms. Le Pen has worked hard to prettify the National Front as a populist  anti-European Union party  there is no avoiding the ugliness of what it stands for. And as her poll numbers have softened in recent days  she has hardened her anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. None The reaction of the two leading candidates could not have been more different. Ms. Le Pen blamed government “laxity” and “naïveté” toward terrorists  while Emmanuel Macron  an independent centrist  said the terrorist threat “will be a fact of daily life in the coming years.” It is impossible to know how the attack will affect the election because so many people remain undecided  and may in the end submit blank ballots — a popular form of protest in France. Some 30 percent of registered voters may not show up at all — compared with 20 percent in the first round of voting in 2012 — making it likely that abstention will be the most popular choice in the early balloting. None Close behind Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are the center-right Républicains candidate François Fillon and the far-left populist Jean-Luc Mélenchon. They are also virtually tied  with Mr. Fillon at 19.5 percent and Mr. Mélenchon at 18.5. Mr. Fillon  who was the front-runner after an upset in his party’s primary  lost support after it was revealed that he had paid his wife and children around $1 million in public money that they may not have earned. Mr. Mélenchon had an astonishing last-minute surge after performing well in televised debates  and in a show of how modern  even futuristic  he is  his campaign has used holographic appearances to simultaneously reach supporters in multiple cities. While people interviewed at the market were unanimous in their aversion to Ms. Le Pen  they were split on whom they were for. That could be a sign of how Pantin  the “Brooklyn of Paris ” has changed with the arrival of arty types and young families who can’t afford Paris proper. In addition  some were adamant that if their candidate didn’t make it to the second round  they would not be able to choose another. One man said  “If Fillon isn’t on the final ballot  my decision is simple: I’m going fishing.” This important election may be decided simply by turnout. The winner could lead France into a Brexit-style referendum on European Union membership. The country could veer far to the left — with potentially huge effects on global markets — or hard right  setting off a Trump-administration-style witch hunt against immigrants  especially Muslims. Of the four leading candidates  all but Mr. Macron are likely to be friendlier to President Vladimir Putin of Russia. Whatever happens  the French will probably remain as politically divided after the election as they are now. Hannah  a 45-year-old woman at the market on Wednesday  said she would vote for Mr. Hamon. “The election will be a catastrophe ” she said. “France is divided in four. Whatever the result  three-quarters of the people will not be happy.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/books/review-in-alfred-hitchcock-a-brief-life-fear-drives-a-master-of-suspense.html,Review: In ‘Alfred Hitchcock: A Brief Life ’ Fear Drives a Master of Suspense Advertisement Supported by Books of The Times None “Luck is everything ” Alfred Hitchcock once remarked. “My good luck in life was to be a really frightened person. I’m fortunate to be a coward  to have a low threshold of fear  because a hero couldn’t make a good suspense film.” Hitchcock had copious anxieties. As a fat  lonely child  he was frightened of authority figures  be they police officers  priests or teachers  he was fearful of falling  and positively phobic about eggs. But he used his visual imagination and technical mastery to turn those anxieties into movies that would reshape cinematic history. Entire genres owe debts to his work  including modern thrillers (like “Jaws” and every Bond movie ever made)  horror and slasher films  disaster pictures and psychological suspense dramas. And his distinctive use of montage  camera angles and symbolic images would be consciously or unconsciously appropriated by generations of filmmakers. More than a century after his birth  Hitchcock remains our contemporary because the world of menace he conjured embodies our deepest  most existential fears. Fears (especially resonant today) that the universe is irrational  that evil lies around the corner  that ordinary life can be ripped apart at any moment by some random unforeseen event — in the case of his films  by mistaken identity (“North by Northwest”)  flocks of murderous birds (“The Birds”)  the unexpected arrival of a malign visitor (“Shadow of a Doubt”). None The latest volume  “Alfred Hitchcock: A Brief Life ” by the novelist and biographer Peter Ackroyd  offers no new revelations  but it provides a smart  fluent overview of the director’s life and art  and the mysterious dynamic between the two. As with other serious books on Hitchcock  this volume will be judged  partly  by how closely the author’s take on various films accords with the reader’s own. In this case  “Notorious” — Hitchcock’s darkly brilliant masterpiece  in this viewer’s opinion — is hastily dismissed in a couple of pages  while the self-important “Vertigo” (which seems to be enjoying a surge in popularity these days) is minutely analyzed and dissected. Nearly as much time is spent on portentous fluff (like the dreadful “Marnie” and the oddly listless “Topaz”) as on the bravura and still stylish “North by Northwest.” But Mr. Ackroyd does deftly situate Hitchcock’s work in the rapidly emerging film industry. He succinctly sketches in Hitchcock’s apprenticeship — how he absorbed lessons in chiaroscuro from the German Expressionist master F. W. Murnau  and the art of montage from the great Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein. Mr. Ackroyd also points out that his British films tend to be more grounded in a particular time and place  compared with his glossier Hollywood productions  which often “float free from social ties” and “exist in some large indefinite space.” Mr. Ackroyd reminds us that Hitchcock believed that “civilization is as thin as ice  beneath which lie depths and darknesses ” and that his obsession with precision and control (manifested in his preference for shooting on carefully constructed sets  and his penchant for cruelly manipulating his actors) was a means of guarding against such cracks in the ice. Images and plot twists seem to have come more easily to Hitchcock than character work  which he left largely to screenwriters. And many of the famous set pieces in his movies — the shower scene in “Psycho ” the crop duster scene in “North by Northwest” — Mr. Ackroyd suggests  were part of the director’s initial inspiration. In Mr. Ackroyd’s view  “Rear Window ” about voyeurism  was one of Hitchcock’s most personal films. In it  James Stewart plays a photographer named Jeff  immobilized by a broken leg  who watches the suspicious goings-on in an apartment building across the way. “It could even be said ” Mr. Ackroyd writes  “that in fashioning Jeff he had created an image of himself — the man hiding behind the camera who creates a fantasy world out of observable reality.” None Alfred Hitchcock A Brief Life By Peter Ackroyd Illustrated. 276 pages.

None Daphne du Maurier’s 1938 novel “Rebecca” opens memorably: “Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.” As it turns out  Manderley  Maxim de Winter’s grand Cornish estate  is more nightmare than dream  the scene of psychological torment  lies and murder  its holiday appeal ranking somewhere between Ann Radcliffe’s castle of Udolpho and Stephen King’s Overlook Hotel. In Gina Wohlsdorf’s debut novel  “Security ” the self-made real estate developer Charles Destin Jr. names his new resort after de Winter’s notorious pile. (It’s suggested that Destin Sr.’s recorded readings of “Rebecca” were an influence.) With Manderley’s “Party of the Year” weeks away  what could possibly go wrong? The story’s heroine  Tessa  superintends the party’s finishing touches. (Among other gimmicks  Destin has undertaken to pour champagne into an elaborate 1 000-glass pyramid  comparing the display to “the miracle of Jesus and his disciples feeding the 5 000 with five loaves and two fish.”) Wohlsdorf conjures Tessa from action-movie central casting: “Tessa never cries”  “Tessa is a difficult woman to love. She likes sex  but she also likes boxing”  “Tessa’s a difficult person to get to know”  “Tessa is an ambulant contradiction. She is at once strikingly strong and heart-­rendingly vulnerable.” Piecemeal  we’re provided with details of her clouded past. A wildly gesticulating French chef (“ ‘The dishwasher. She is broken!’ He shakes a fist in the air”)  as well as various cleaners and caterers  fill out the staff. A Rhodes scholar-cum-former member of the Navy SEALs oversees security. (Readers expecting something along the lines of Steven Seagal’s knife-wielding ­ex-SEAL/cook from “Under Siege” will be disappointed.) We are soon told by the mysteriously omniscient narrator that two capital-K killers are on the loose  each wearing the mask from the “Halloween” movies. (Lest there be any confusion: “It’s the same mask from the ‘Halloween’ movies  the ones with Jamie Lee Curtis.”) One of the marauders  called “the Thinker” (he “often rests his masked head on his fist. When he does this  he resembles Rodin’s famous sculpture ‘The Thinker’ ”)  keeps watch as his taller  brawnier accomplice  “the Killer ” proceeds from room to room  murdering coolly and meticulously: “The Killer . . . draws the blade across his throat slowly enough to relish the act  but quickly enough that he can . . . speed-walk to the kitchen  discard the knife in the sink  wash up . . . and situate himself in the dining chair  napkin in lap  steam still rising from the cuisine  the first forkful of which — he chooses a bite of cordon bleu and half a broccoli floret.” In other words  Patrick Bateman meets Michael Myers. Though the killers’ motives are unclear  their violent spree is rendered vividly through the hotel’s pervasive network of cameras. To simulate the effect  Wohlsdorf narrates various scenes in split screen  with the page divided into columns following each camera’s vantage. While I appreciate the novelty  the layout feels more school textbook than thriller. The scheme is not helped by the narrator’s musings on security and safety: “The best security is invisible security” (repeated twice more  later  for emphasis)  “The most thorough safety is safety one’s object of protection doesn’t know about”  “Security means never having to say you’re sorry.” (O.K.  I made up the last one.) Wohlsdorf is fond of paradoxes: “Tessa looks bottomlessly sad  because she looks almost happy”  “If nothing matters  then everything does”  “It was senseless. It made perfect sense.” And then there are her at-times puzzling analogies: “He keeps talking  like his words are rocks and speech is their ­momentum down a hillside”  “It’s as if they see El Dorado in the banality of the other”  “Tessa and Brian are like scared gods in a bleached sea.” The plot moves along — bodies pile up  Tessa reckons with her past and comes face to mask with the killers — but the victims generally lack flesh. For all the blood  “Security” is strangely bloodless. Maxwell Carter writes frequently on ­popular culture for the Book Review and other ­publications.

Advertisement Supported by Fiction When you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site  we earn an affiliate commission. None None Christine Mangan’s camera-ready first novel  “Tangerine ” opens with three men hauling a corpse — pecked by magpies and missing its eyes — from the sea. Whose body is this  and how did it end up in the water? In alternating chapters  two female narrators provide the long  lurid and psychologically complex answer. Neither woman is necessarily trustworthy  a trait they share with the unreliable female narrators of recent best sellers like “Gone Girl” and “The Girl on the Train.” Like those novels  “Tangerine” is on track to become a film  with Scarlett Johansson tentatively attached to star. Mangan draws her narrators with broad strokes  using classic Hollywood color coding. Alice Shipley is pale  rich and emotionally fragile. She wears lace gloves and pearls. Lucy Mason is dark  voluptuous and worldly. She smokes. They meet on their first day at Bennington College in the mid-1950s and develop one of those possessive  erotically charged friendships that never seem to end well. The two young women experience — or perhaps instigate — an unspecified tragedy. Then Alice drops out of school  marries and flees to Tangier with her caddish new husband  John  to escape the traumatic memory  and perhaps Lucy as well. Soon  though  Lucy turns up unannounced at Alice’s Tangier flat. Alice’s response: “I thought of the few works of Shakespeare I knew and the line that frequently rattled in my brain — what’s past is prologue.” But what exactly is that past? As Lucy and Alice re-establish a volatile intimacy over sugary mint tea in sweltering Tangier cafes  via flashback we gradually learn the details of that earlier mystery  which unfolds in frosty Vermont. It’s as if Mangan couldn’t decide whether to write a homage to Donna Tartt’s “The Secret History” or a sun-drenched novel of dissolute Westerners abroad in the tradition of Patricia Highsmith and Paul Bowles  so she tried to do both. She mostly succeeds. None Mangan  who has a doctorate in English  wrote her dissertation on 18th-century Gothic literature and she knows all the notes to hit to create lush  sinister atmosphere and to prolong suspense. Unfortunately  she hits them all  and she hits them a little too hard. Both narrators periodically lapse into the language of academia  bluntly signaling how we should interpret the narrative rather than letting us figure it out for ourselves. Alice worries that her tone of voice is “wavering somewhere between lighthearted and serious  skirting the liminal boundaries between laughing and crying.” In 1956  a young woman in a white pillbox hat would not have talked about liminal boundaries. When Lucy refers to the “intertextuality” that once existed between her and Alice  she uses a term coined by the French semiotician Julia Kristeva a decade after the novel takes place. At times  “Tangerine” reads as if it were reverse-engineered from a scholarly paper about suspense fiction. Happily  you can write a satisfying  juicy thriller this way  if not a blazingly original one.

None None “Beat It” was the third single from “Thriller” to be released after hits like “The Girl Is Mine” and “Billie Jean ” and features a dance routine that brings two rival gangs together. Over the years  the song has been sampled by Justin Bieber  Fergie and Eminem  to name a few. None “Thriller” is a wonderful pop record  the latest statement by one of the great singers in popular music today. But it is more than that. It is as hopeful a sign as we have had yet that the destructive barriers that spring up regularly between white and black music — and between whites and blacks — in this culture may be breached once again. Most important of all  it is another signpost on the road to Michael Jackson’s own artistic fulfillment. None None None Over the last year  Mr. Jackson’s songs have defined dance music. The arrangements on the “Thriller” album mesh his piping voice with a muscular blend of real and electronic sounds  in rhythms that can’t be categorized as rock or funk or disco. “Thriller” is now played on rock radio stations that cater largely to young white listeners as well as on urban dance-music stations that appeal largely to blacks. Before “Thriller ” few entertainers were able to cross that subtle color line. A similar crossover has taken place on cable television  where Mr. Jackson’s video clips are shown on programs that rarely offer black performers.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/sports/uconn-notre-dame-women-final-four.html,Notre Dame  a UConn Nemesis  Topples the Huskies in a Final Four Thriller Advertisement Supported by None COLUMBUS  Ohio — Connecticut has never lost in the championship game at the women’s Final Four  unblemished in collecting 11 N.C.A.A. basketball titles. But the Huskies can be vulnerable in the taut  desperate preamble of the semifinals. No one understands this more acutely than Notre Dame. For the fourth time since 2001  the Irish defeated the Huskies in the national semis  winning  91-89  on Friday on a jumper by guard Arike Ogunbowale with one second remaining in overtime. The Irish advanced to Sunday’s championship game against Mississippi State  which won its semifinal against Louisville in overtime. The victory over UConn demonstrated a remarkable resilience by Notre Dame  whose thin roster is missing four players with torn anterior cruciate ligaments  a scourge of women’s sports. Friday’s game became a fierce back-and-forth  one team making a determined run  the other answering  both overcoming deficits that expanded to double figures. And for a second consecutive year in the Final Four  UConn (36-1) felt the sting of defeat in the final seconds of overtime. On Friday  the Huskies seemed finished near the end of regulation  trailing by 79-74 with 21.3 seconds left before Napheesa Collier (24 points) hit a 3-pointer and Kia Nurse stole the inbounds pass and drove for a layup to tie the score  forcing five extra minutes. In overtime  Notre Dame (34-3) drew ahead  but UConn responded. A 3-pointer by Crystal Dangerfield tied the score at 89-89 with 27 seconds left. Notre Dame called timeout with 13 seconds remaining and planned to isolate Ogunbowale (27 points) on the right wing and have her drive to the basket with about five seconds remaining  in the belief that UConn would not try to foul. But UConn’s defense made it difficult for Ogunbowale to get the ball as planned. Finally  with overtime about to expire  she shot from just inside the 3-point arc and hit nothing but net  giving Notre Dame its stirring victory. Jackie Young led the Irish with her career high of 32 points. “I didn’t know it was going in  but it felt good ” Ogunbowale said. Muffet McGraw  Notre Dame’s coach  acknowledged that the play  and ultimately the victory  had resulted more from improvisation than from design. “I probably should thank every Catholic from coast to coast for all the prayers on Good Friday ” she said. Importantly for the Irish  a deep familiarity with UConn had developed over the years  creating self-assurance and stonewashing any nervousness from their annual matchup in the regular season and  with regularity  another meeting in the tournament. “They’re just another team ” guard Marina Mabrey said. As partners in the old Big East Conference  the teams once played as many as four times a season. Their coaches — Notre Dame’s McGraw and UConn’s Geno Auriemma — obsessively followed each other’s performances. The rivalry became the most enthralling in women’s college basketball. It grew heated  sometimes to the point of bitterness. Now they are in different leagues — the Irish play in the Atlantic Coast Conference  the Huskies in the American Athletic Conference — and the rivalry is less intense  but no less predictive of deep runs in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Notre Dame prevailed over UConn in the semifinals in 2001  when the Irish won their only national title  and did it again in 2011 and 2012  as well as on Friday. For the second consecutive year  UConn failed to reach the championship game. Last year  defeat came on a stunning jumper by Mississippi State in overtime that snapped the Huskies’ 111-game winning streak. Again on Friday  the Huskies were left to contemplate going home empty-handed — despite having won 147 of their last 149 games. “When you do something and it seems like it’s so effortless  you do get numb and forget it’s difficult ” Auriemma said of UConn’s raft of national titles. “It’s very difficult. There are no bad teams. There are no bad players. You can’t luck into a national championship. You have to play great.” In these types of games  he continued  a necessary selfishness often prevails. One team often does not collectively beat another  he said. Instead  “there’s one or two players that just make unbelievable plays and just dominate the game.” Women’s college basketball is now left to deliberate whether UConn’s stumble represented an anomaly or the hint of something larger — the beginning of a shift toward greater parity in the women’s game  which has developed on a track parallel to the men’s game. The men’s N.C.A.A. tournament began in 1939  the women’s in 1982. In the first 37 years of the men’s tournament Coach John Wooden and U.C.L.A. won 10 titles. In the first 37 years of the women’s tournament Auriemma and UConn have won 11 titles. Will UConn’s dominance begin to fade  as U.C.L.A’s did? It is far too early to tell  said Coach Joanne P. McCallie of Duke  which lost to UConn in the semifinals of the Albany Region. UConn has signed the nation’s top recruit for next season  Christyn Williams  a 5-foot-11 guard from Arkansas. And Auriemma  who just turned 64  has hinted that he might coach until he is 70. UConn is still the “king and queen and leader of the pack ” McCallie said. “Let’s look at the next four years. That will be the pattern to evaluate.” Still  there is undeniable equalizing occurring in women’s college basketball. Tennessee  an eight-time national champion  has not reached the Final Four since Coach Pat Summitt retired and died from early-onset Alzheimer’s disease. This season  Tennessee lost at home for the first time in the N.C.A.A. tournament. South Carolina  the 2017 champion  and Mississippi State  in the Final Four for a second consecutive season  have supplanted Tennessee as powers in the Southeastern Conference. “Anytime you can show some parity in our game on any level  it’s always good ” said Dawn Staley  the South Carolina coach  who won the title last year. A leveling of the playing field “gives other coaches hope to keep on coaching.” Oregon  U.C.L.A. and Oregon State have loosened the stranglehold that Stanford  a two-time champion and a Final Four regular  once had on the Pac-12 Conference. And two 11th seeds — Buffalo and Central Michigan — reached the round of 16 in the 2018 tournament. Buffalo provided a shrewd example of the recruiting that mid-majors have undertaken to compete with opponents in the so-called Power 5 conferences. Of Buffalo’s 14 players this season  seven were international — four from Australia  two from Canada and one from Nigeria. “Women are not just saying  ‘I’m going to Connecticut’  they’re going everywhere now ” said Buffalo Coach Felisha Legette-Jack. “My colleagues are not saying  ‘Come play for me because I’m at this school.’ They’re saying  ‘Come play with me because of this relationship I’m building with you.’ We’re not looking at buildings anymore  we’re looking at people.” True parity in women’s college basketball may not arrive  McCallie said  until attendance is reliable enough during the early rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament for all teams to play on neutral courts. For now  the top four seeds in each region are eligible to play the first and second rounds on their home courts. “I think the only thing we have trouble with is where we play  the neutral court versus the home court  because we’ve got to draw fans ” McCallie said. “I think eventually that would be the next step.” Before the tournament began  Auriemma urged a group of UConn fans to enjoy what the Huskies have accomplished  because “this isn’t going to last forever.” Friday’s game  he said with gallows humor  was a “great learning tool.” “But I’m a pretty smart guy ” he added. “I don’t need to learn this two years in a row.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/movies/double-lover-review-francois-ozon.html,Review: ‘Double Lover’ Is a Knotty Delight of a Thriller Advertisement Supported by None In the opening scene of “Double Lover ” its protagonist  Chloé (Marine Vacth)  is seen getting her hair cut. Her wet hair  pale face and the gray background impart a simple elegance to the sequence. The following scene takes place in the bleaker confines of a gynecologist’s office. In one shot  the screen fills with the colors pink and silver. Viewers may wonder exactly what they are seeing at first  but as the camera zooms out it becomes clear: a speculum seen from the point of view of a doctor conducting a vaginal examination. The shot dissolves into a geometrically corresponding close-up of Chloé’s eye. The straightforward explicitness of the imagery is a hallmark of François Ozon  the film’s director (his best known films include the thrillers “See the Sea” and “Swimming Pool”)  the juxtaposition is very Georges Bataille (he wrote a piece of outré eroticism titled “Story of the Eye”). Some might say it’s all very French  and perhaps it is. But it does make one sit up and take notice. The clever thing about it is that it’s not until the movie is almost over that the viewer can fully understand this imagery as something more than an effective  but perhaps idle provocation. Chloé  looking underweight  has complained about chronic stomach pains to her gynecologist. And on that doctor’s advice  she starts seeing a psychoanalyst  Paul (Jérémie Renier). He’s handsome  gentle  compassionate. He “cures” her  they confess romantic feelings for each other  and they move in together. One small glitch is that he does not much care for her cat Milo. A bigger glitch comes soon after that: Chloé meets another psychoanalyst  Paul’s double  who claims to be his twin brother. He’s a rougher character who likes his own cat  a specimen of a rare breed. He thinks he can cure Chloé of a new complaint  and there’s lots of athletic sex involved in the treatment. What’s going on here? The doubling imagery  the recurring spiral staircases  and so much else engulfing Chloé make this thriller unusually engrossing. “Double Lover” nods a bit to David Cronenberg’s “Dead Ringers” (1988) and Roman Polanski’s “The Tenant” (1976)  two arguably classic thrillers on doppelgängers and madness  and Mr. Ozon’s stylistic gymnastics sometimes bring to mind Brian De Palma  who made a film about good/bad twins early in his career. But “Double Lover ” which Mr. Ozon “freely adapted” from the Joyce Carol Oates book “Lives of the Twins ” spins its influences into a frenzy that ultimately reveals the story to be very much its own thing. And a crazy  and eventually strangely moving  thing it is. As elaborate as its visuals are  the movie is also intimate. There aren’t many characters besides Chloé and the twins  which adds to the frisson late in the movie when the great Jacqueline Bisset makes her entrance.

Fortunately  no one told Follett. “A Column of Fire ” Follett’s newest novel  is a nearly-thousand-page doorstop focused on the religious wars of 16th-century England  with plenty of detours. The Protestant Reformation has just begun. In France and Spain  the Catholic Church and gentry are desperate to stamp it out. In England  the Protestant Queen Elizabeth faces enemies foreign and domestic  and  despite her promises of tolerance  executes Catholic rebels. As is typical for a historical novel  Follett centers the era’s pivotal moments on a small group of invented characters. The most important are Ned Willard  a Protestant who manages a spy service to protect the queen  and Rollo Fitzgerald  a Catholic who spends his life trying to dethrone her. Naturally  Ned and Rollo have known each other since childhood. Naturally  they didn’t like each other even then  for Rollo helped stop his sister Margery from marrying Ned. The three  and a host of others  play crucial roles in real events like the St. Bartholomew’s Day massacre in Paris in 1572 and the British defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588. “A Column of Fire” serves as a useful reminder that religious tolerance comes slowly — that Catholics and Protestants once battled each other as fiercely and bloodily as Sunni and Shia. Follett also makes a point of showing how clever aristocrats used Christianity to gain an edge in business disputes. The novel covers so much ground and has so many voices that its characters can sometimes come off as a little less than three-dimensional. To compensate  it gives us what novels rarely do: the bittersweet chance to follow them from birth to death. But the world goes on  in life and in fiction. “A Column of Fire” ends with the promise of a Puritan voyage on the Mayflower. I suspect more than a few of Follett’s readers will be happy if he brings them to the New World in his next epic. None None DeMille writes in the acknowledgments that he took a similar trip to Cuba for research. If the novel is any guide  he didn’t enjoy it much. “There didn’t seem to be any reason for this town’s existence ” his narrator remarks of one city. The effect is less Paul Theroux and more cranky grandpa  a footsore cruise-shipper’s point of view. The affair in question takes place between this narrator  Daniel “Mac” MacCormick  an Afghan War veteran who now runs fishing charters out of Key West  and Sara Ortega  a Cuban-American who — spoiler alert! — may or may not have a boyfriend. Sara recruits Mac to help her steal $60 million in cash that’s supposedly been stashed in a cave since Castro took power. Among the many questions that Mac should ask but doesn’t before taking the job is whether that money could really have stayed hidden in such a place  even one supposedly “sealed by Sara’s grandfather ” for more than half a century. Sara and her backers promise him $3 million for his help  but the reader knows that his real motivation for agreeing to risk his life on this flaky plot is the chance to sleep with Sara. Because he’s having a midlife crisis post-Wall Street and combat careers  and because she’s hot. If you are expecting slow-building romance  think again. Our heroes rut early and often. Mac refers to his “pepino ” a term that made me want to stop-loss him and send him back to Kabul. With barely 100 pages left  he and Sara roll out of bed long enough to escape Havana and meet the ship that will take them back to Key West. Complications ensue. “The Cuban Affair” wakes up. Better late than never. None “Special Envoy” is an exceedingly French spy thriller. Which is to say  it’s not really a thriller at all  and even less about spying. A pretty woman is kidnapped off the street in Paris  moved deep into the French countryside  held for months. Her kidnappers seem to be connected with the D.G.S.E.  the French equivalent of the C.I.A. But who they are and what they want from her remain oddly opaque. She is unafraid and passive  making no efforts to escape. Two kidnappers fall for her and move her to the top of a wind turbine. You read that right. None None of this seems either very realistic or very meaningful  which is why I haven’t even bothered with the names of the characters. I’m not exactly criticizing  either  I don’t think Echenoz wants us to care too much. He occasionally even breaks the fourth wall  berating himself for the plot’s thinness. (“We are all a little embarrassed ” he writes of his characters and himself in one breath  “Tausk by the humiliation of having to ask his half brother for help  Hubert by the fact that Tausk is yet again bothering him without offering a dime in return  and me by this completely unoriginal plotline.”) Eventually the pieces of said plot do come together. The D.G.S.E. gives the woman a mission. She accepts its request as easily as she does her captivity  and off she goes to North Korea. Is Echenoz making deep points about the omnipotence of the French spy services and the ennui of the average Parisien? Or is he just amusing himself  and us? Only he can be sure.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/arts/television/false-flag-hulu-review-israel-export.html,Review: With ‘False Flag ’ Israel Exports Another Fine Thriller Advertisement Supported by None None The show plunges into action  with breathless TV reports that five Israeli citizens  presumably undercover Mossad agents  have been caught on video kidnapping an Iranian government minister from his Moscow hotel room. The suspects — including a chemist  a preschool teacher and a bride on her wedding day — watch the fuzzy footage in disbelief and insist they weren’t in Russia and have no idea what’s going on. The English title points to the truth that the plot dances with briefly but fairly quickly gives up: The five (or most of them  anyway) are indeed being framed. The show’s salient questions  answered over eight fast-paced  highly entertaining episodes  are by whom and for what purpose? None “False Flag ” created by Maria Feldman and Amit Cohen and written by Mr. Cohen  takes that scenario and fully exploits its melodramatic possibilities. The five may not be guilty of kidnapping but they’re all guilty of something — an affair  a hidden criminal past  an insatiable appetite for attention — that complicates their attempts to prove their innocence and provides the show with five mysteries for the price of one. None Like those predecessors  “False Flag” is less fancy and more naturalistic than its American counterparts  with a dry humor and a low-key efficiency in generating suspense. The tension is maintained through constant movement and the clash of personalities rather than bloodshed — there’s violence  but the body count is lower than it would be in an American series  at least until an awkwardly handled shootout in the finale. (That scene is part of the heavy-handed setup for a second season that hasn’t yet been made  the first season was shown in Israel in 2015.) As for the story  the United States doesn’t figure at all  except for one throwaway line that answers an obvious question and sums up a worldview. “The kidnappers did a clean job ” a Mossad operative says. “It wasn’t the Americans.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/04/movies/dark-meridian-review-new-orleans.html,Review: ‘Dark Meridian’ Is a Crime Thriller Starring New Orleans Advertisement Supported by None None The story begins when Spencer (James Moses Black)  a cop in league with a local gangster  confronts one of the gangster’s sons  Tevi (Dave Davis)  outside the warehouse that he’s staking out — minutes before a blood bath inside that leaves only one survivor. Quentin Tarantino-style flashbacks illuminate what happened. Inside the warehouse  Tevi and his father’s henchmen had been avenging the killing of Tevi’s brother. But Tevi  untrusting of the rival gangsters who delivered the ostensible murderer (Billy Slaughter)  wasn’t sure they had the right guy. In the present time frame  Tevi  the smart son who could have avoided a life of crime  and the avuncular Spencer team up track down the wounded man who escaped the scene. Mr. Hickman clearly knows New Orleans and has branched out beyond obvious locations  making the city a central presence. The acting  on the other hand  might best be described as uneven  and a hollow finale mutes whatever impact the movie might have had as a character study. “Dark Meridian” proves that Mr. Hickman has the capacity to surprise  but it doesn’t prove much more.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/sports/tennis/australian-open-simona-halep-.html,Australian Open: No. 1 Simona Halep Survives a Nearly 4-Hour Thriller Advertisement Supported by None MELBOURNE  Australia — Top-seeded Simona Halep survived a marathon third-round battle with 76th-ranked Lauren Davis on Saturday at the Australian Open  ultimately prevailing  4-6  6-4  15-13  after three hours and 44 minutes. “I’m almost dead ” Halep  a 26-year-old Romanian  said in her on-court interview. “But it’s nice that we could show good tennis.” Halep saved three match points at 10-11  and she finally served out the match on her fourth try. She had been up a break at 5-4  6-5 and 8-7 in the third  which lasted two hours and 22 minutes. Davis  a 24-year-old American  said she had slipped into an autopilot of sorts as the match continued into nearly uncharted scoreboard territory. “We were both fighting our hearts out ” Davis said. “Every point was just super-long. I mean  I got to the point where I was so tired  where I just told myself to swing and move. And  for the most part  it was very effective  because I didn’t really feel any pressure or anything.” Davis has worked to build more firepower into her game in recent years  and she hit 52 winners compared with 27 for Halep. Davis held up well through the grueling battle but needed two medical timeouts for foot treatment in the third set. One involved tending to a problem more common among ultrarunners: A toenail began to fall off. After Davis received medical attention for it  her movement appeared unimpeded. Halep had badly rolled her left ankle during her first-round victory over the Australian wild card Destanee Aiava  but she surprised herself by moving with relative ease in her second-round win over Eugenie Bouchard. Against Davis  Halep was more aggressive early in rallies and dominated their shorter exchanges  while the American consistently prevailed in longer rallies. For better or worse  Halep said  she could not feel her ankle  which was tightly taped and numbed by painkillers. Darren Cahill  who has coached Halep for several years  said she prevailed because she had “really toughened up over the past couple of years.” “She’s battling out every single match ” Cahill said. “Whoever won that match  I thought it was a minor miracle to go through the ups and downs of that  the roller coaster. I said to her  ‘I’m not sure I’ve sat through a more emotional tennis match  in all my years of coaching.’” “It’s one for the ages  and a credit to both ladies ” he added. “I thought they were magnificent.” Halep’s survival came three days after second-seeded Caroline Wozniacki saved two match points to keep herself in the tournament  and two days after third-seeded Garbiñe Muguruza was eliminated in the third round. Altogether  three of the top seven seeds in the women’s draw have departed. And Halep survived only by battling through one of the toughest matches in the tournament’s history. It tied the record for most games in a women’s match at this event  but was not the longest in time spent. That was played in 2011  when Francesca Schiavone beat Svetlana Kuznetsova  16-14  in the third set of a match that lasted a full hour more than Halep’s win over Davis. Halep’s next opponent will be Naomi Osaka  who defeated 18th-seeded Ashleigh Barty  6-4  6-2. Osaka  ranked 72nd in the world  had 12 aces and 24 winners. Barty was the last Australian woman remaining in the singles draw. Madison Keys  a United States Open finalist  also moved through to the fourth round  with a 6-3  6-4 win over Ana Bogdan at Margaret Court Arena. The 17th-seeded Keys  who lost in the United States Open final last year to Sloane Stephens  saved three break points serving for the match before clinching it on her first match point when Bogdan netted a backhand. Keys missed last year’s Australian Open after having surgery to repair her injured left wrist. She then played only one match after the U.S. Open before shutting down her season early to let the wrist heal. It has helped her start the new season feeling mentally fresh  as well. “I finished the U.S. Open and I was exhausted ” she said. “So as amazing as that run was  the combination of being exhausted from that and having a wrist that still wasn’t 100 percent perfect  I just needed to kind of shut it down  calm down  and then I was really excited to start the new season.” Keys is the only one of the four American women who reached the semifinals at the U.S. Open last September still in contention in Melbourne — Stephens  Venus Williams and CoCo Vandeweghe were all eliminated in the first round. Keys will next play Caroline Garcia  a 6-3  5-7  6-2 winner over Aliaksandra Sasnovich. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/world/asia/salman-khan-india-blackbucks.html,Salman Khan  Bollywood Superstar  Is Convicted of Killing Antelopes Advertisement Supported by None NEW DELHI — An Indian court convicted the Bollywood star Salman Khan on Thursday in two cases of killing rare antelopes  settling — for now — a bitter legal battle that has stretched over nearly 20 years. In pronouncing the verdict  Dev Kumar Khatri  the chief magistrate of the court in Rajasthan State  called Mr. Khan a “habitual offender” against India’s wildlife protection laws. Mr. Khatri sentenced Mr. Khan to five years in prison  and also directed him to pay a small fine. Four other actors accused of being involved in killing the antelopes  called blackbucks and protected under the law  were acquitted for lack of evidence. Mr. Khan is expected to spend the night in jail in the city of Jodhpur. His lawyers said they would appeal the decision and apply for bail. The case stretches back to 1998  when prosecutors said Mr. Khan  one of India’s biggest stars  went hunting with several other actors outside a forest reserve near Jodhpur while shooting the film “Hum Saath Saath Hain.” None Reports of the hunting trip set off protests  and Mr. Khan was taken into custody.

None None A friend told Ms. Rabadi that she had been “stupid” for talking back to Mr. Mukhtar. But shortly after the meeting  she was offered the role. “Sheikh Mukhtar liked my spirit ” she said. Nargis Rabadi was born in Mumbai  then called Bombay  to a family of Parsis  followers of Zoroaster. Her father  who died when she was 3  was a priest in a temple. After his death  Ms. Rabadi’s mother cooked at religious functions for extra cash. Ms. Rabadi and her elder sister  Mani  helped out by working in a toy factory run by the Indian multinational company Tata. The girls’ tuition was covered in exchange for a few hours of work after classes. Following Ms. Rabadi’s acting break in 1949  she appeared mostly in supporting roles in a career that stretched over 60 years  including as the lovable grandmother Choti Nani on the popular sitcom “Dekh Bhai Dekh.” Known for her comedic timing  she attributed her long career to her eagerness for work of any kind. “I did whatever role came to me and did not just wait for big roles ” she once said. Ms. Rabadi said her one big mistake in life was getting married. Her marriage to the director Sultan Ahmed lasted seven years and proved a trying time for Ms. Rabadi  who suffered two miscarriages.

Now  we’re adding the stories of other remarkable people. 1933-1969 A Bollywood legend whose tragic life mirrored Marilyn Monroe’s. None It was probably the first ghost story in Indian cinema. A bewildered young man in a mansion chasing glimpses of an ethereal  veiled beauty. The movie  “Mahal ” was a huge success  making the lead actress  Madhubala  who was barely 16  a superstar overnight. None None None Obituary writing is more about life than death: the last word  a testament to a human contribution. Yet who gets remembered — and how — inherently involves judgment. To look back at the obituary archives can  therefore  be a stark lesson in how society valued various achievements and achievers. None None None None 1862-1931 Took on racism in the Deep South with powerful reporting on lynchings. None It was not all that unusual when  in 1892  a mob dragged Thomas Moss out of a Memphis jail in his pajamas and shot him to death over a feud that began with a game of marbles. But his lynching changed history because of its effect on one of the nation’s most influential journalists  who was also the godmother of his first child: Ida B. Wells. “It is with no pleasure that I have dipped my hands in the corruption here exposed ” Wells wrote in 1892 in the introduction to “Southern Horrors ” one of her seminal works about lynching  “Somebody must show that the Afro-American race is more sinned against than sinning  and it seems to have fallen upon me to do so.” c. 1875-1907 A feminist poet and revolutionary who became a martyr known as China’s ‘Joan of Arc.’ None None But her ambitions ran up against China’s deeply rooted patriarchal society  which held that a woman’s place remained in the home.

Clearly it wasn’t for fishing  they said. And what were these stringed things with long handles? 1923-1971 A photographer whose portraits have compelled or repelled generations of viewers. None None Diane Arbus was a daughter of privilege who spent much of her adult life documenting those on the periphery of society. Since she killed herself in 1971  her unblinking portraits have made her a seminal figure in modern-day photography and an influence on three generations of photographers  though she is perhaps just as famous for her unconventional lifestyle and her suicide. 1945-1992 A transgender pioneer and activist who was a fixture of Greenwich Village street life. None None None 1932-1963 A postwar poet unafraid to confront her own despair. None She made sure to spare the children  leaving milk and bread for the two toddlers to find when they woke up. She stuffed the cracks of the doors and windows with cloths and tea towels. Then she turned on the gas. On the morning of Feb. 11  1963  a Monday  a nurse found the poet Sylvia Plath in her flat on Fitzroy Road in London  an address where W.B. Yeats had once lived. She was “lying on the floor of the kitchen with her head resting on the oven ” according to a local paper  the St. Pancras Chronicle. 1920-1951 Cancer cells were taken from her body without permission. They led to a medical revolution. None She never traveled farther than Baltimore from her family home in southern Virginia  but her cells have traveled around the earth and far above it  too. She was buried in an unmarked grave  but the trillions of those cells — generated from a tiny patch taken from her body — are labeled in university labs and biotechnology companies across the world  where they continue to spawn and to play the critical role in a 67-year parade of medical advances. 1843-1903 Oversaw the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge after her engineer husband fell ill. None It was not customary for a woman to accompany a man to a construction site in the late 19th century. Petticoats tended to get in the way of physical work. But when Washington A. Roebling  the chief engineer of the Brooklyn Bridge  fell ill  it was his wife  Emily Warren Roebling  who stepped in — managing  liaising and politicking between city officials  workers  and her husband’s bedside to see the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge to completion. She would become the first person to cross the bridge  too — carrying a rooster with her  as the story has it  for good luck. 1891-1964 A Harlem Renaissance-era writer whose heritage informed her modernist take on the topic of race.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/opinion/bollywood-padmavati-ranveer-singh.html,Fear and Prejudice in Bollywood Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None MUMBAI  India — On Dec. 1  Sanjay Leela Bhansali  one of the most opulent and operatic filmmakers in Bollywood  was releasing his movie “Padmavati ” which is based on a mythical Hindu queen. Two weeks before the theatrical release  some Hindu activists from the Rajput warrior caste declared that the movie hurt the sentiments of their community by depicting a Muslim king lusting after a Rajput queen. And they could not permit that to be shown under any circumstance. None None None None Alauddin Khilji did fight and defeat the Rajput king of Chittor in Rajasthan in the early 14th century. Queen Padmavati  however  never existed. The legend of Padmavati was born more than two centuries after Khilji’s death. Malik Muhammad Jayasi  a Sufi Muslim poet  created the character of Padmavati in an epic poem he wrote in the mid-16th century. None None The trailer of the movie suggests that Mr. Bhansali has portrayed Khilji as a savage despite historians’ rather complimentary assessments. Mr. Bhansali’s Khilji has shoulder-length hair  eyes lined with black kohl  and several scars adding menace to his face. He rides furiously ahead of a mighty invading army  pounds men to dust in wrestling matches  bares his teeth after psychopathic laughter and lustily chomps on a massive chunk of meat. None None None The protests around the movie helped create the myth of Hindu sentiments being under siege. Even a fictional queen and a Muslim king have become tools to garner Hindu votes. Fabricating a hostile “other” helps retain power. The methodology has been transparent — generate fear and hatred  and use those to legitimate violence. None Because Bollywood movies are widely publicized and occupy a significant place in everyday conversation  they become perfect targets to generate instant publicity for the groups or individuals attacking them. Bollywood has developed a justifiable sense of being left to the wolves  the state has almost never shown any inclination to prevent or curb violence against films. The film industry itself has failed to offer a unified  collective response. The biggest stars and the most influential filmmakers have stayed silent. There have been no calls for strikes and protests  no appeals for boycotts or shutdowns. They see such attacks as specific to the film  its actors and filmmaker. It doesn’t concern itself about the broader principles of creative freedom. The fear of a mob at their glamorous gates is a factor in their silence but Bollywood stars and producers also have a long history of acquiescence and cowardice in their dealings with power. The assault on Mr. Bhansali’s movie illustrates a bleak scenario where Bollywood’s anxiety about extraconstitutional censorship will weigh heavily on its creative choices. It might just fall back on the old formula of romances and comedies with song and dance routines. Anjum Rajabali has written several Hindi movies and heads the screenwriting program at the Whistling Woods International film school in Mumbai.

He was 67. His daughter  Afshaan Alter Burtram  said the cause was squamous cell carcinoma  a skin cancer. With light skin  blue eyes and blond hair  which later turned bright white  Mr. Alter was an incongruous figure in Bollywood. But he spoke Hindi and Urdu fluently  making him a natural fit for roles like slick diplomats  British colonials  priests and police officers. None He appeared in more than 300 films and a handful of television shows and plays. He was Lord Mountbatten in “Sardar ” a 1993 film about Sardar Patel  the freedom fighter who unified India as the country broke away from British colonization. In Satyajit Ray’s 1977 “Shatranj Ke Khiladi” (“The Chess Players”)  he was the introspective Captain Weston  who  with his love for Urdu poetry  sympathizes with the very rulers of India he is faced with overthrowing as the confidential assistant to a general played by Richard Attenborough. Mr. Alter and Mr. Attenborough crossed paths again in the Oscar-winning “Gandhi” (1982)  directed by Mr. Attenborough  in which Mr. Alter played the British doctor who whispers to Gandhi (Ben Kingsley) that his wife has died.

His parents  James Payne Alter and the former Barbara Beach  were also missionaries. Mr. Alter graduated from the Woodstock School  an international boarding school near the Himalayas  in 1968. He then attended Yale  but he dropped out after a year and a half to move back to India. He taught at a school in Jagadhri  a city in the northern India state of Haryana  and spent his evenings at the cinema with friends watching Hindi movies. It was Rajesh Khanna’s performance in the 1969 drama “Aradhana” (“Worship”)  about a woman who is forced to give up her son at birth  that inspired him to become an actor. (Mr. Khanna played the boy’s father and later the boy himself as an adult.) “I knew instantly that this was  above all  what I wanted to do ” he told The Times. “I wanted to act and act in Hindi movies.” He attended the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune  which had just opened  and graduated in 1974. His first major role was as a customs officer trying to break up an Indian drug ring in Ramanand Sagar’s “Charas” (1976). In 1978 he married Carol Evans  who survives him. Besides her and their daughter  he is survived by their son  Jamie  his brother  John  his sister  Marty Chen  and a grandson. In addition to acting  Mr. Alter wrote for several newspapers and published three books. After he finished acting school  he decided to renounce his American passport to prove he was serious about his career in India. “You have to be truly committed to this country ” he told The Times. “Otherwise you don’t get respect or acceptability.” But he still faced questions about his heritage  and he publicly lamented having to answer them.

He was 79. None None Mr. Kapoor was the romantic lead in numerous Bollywood movies. He was part of a family of actors  directors and producers that included his older brothers Raj  who died in 1988  and Shammi  who died in 2011. Mr. Kapoor appeared in British and American films as well as Hindi ones  including several by the Merchant Ivory production house. Among his better-known English-language films were “The Deceivers” (1988)  a thriller in which he acted alongside Pierce Brosnan  and “Sammy and Rosie Get Laid” (1987)  a comic drama directed by Stephen Frears whose cast included Claire Bloom. Among his scores of film credits  Mr. Kapoor caused a particular stir with “Satyam Shivam Sundaram: Love Sublime ” a 1978 movie directed by his brother Raj in which he did something that had been banned in Hindi films for years: shared an onscreen kiss (several  actually) with his female co-star  Zeenat Aman. The country maintained tight restrictions on filmmakers during Indira Gandhi’s first term as prime minister  when that ended in 1977  one result was a more relaxed film code.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/30/world/asia/china-india-dangal-bollywood.html,China Fears India May Be Edging It Out in Culture Battle Advertisement Supported by None None None None While China’s film industry has long sought both to emulate and compete with Hollywood  the runaway success of “Dangal” has prompted Chinese production companies to turn their gaze from West to East. Suddenly  Chinese companies are racing to snap up all things Bollywood — partnerships and distribution rights  but also Indian directors and screenwriters. And that has led to some unease. None But more and more  the two Asian giants are also competing to project soft power — or cultural influence — outside their borders. And “Dangal” has revived concerns in China that it is falling behind. “China’s development has been very comprehensive in terms of politics  economics and military ” said Jiang Jingkui  director of the Southeast Asian Research Institute at Peking University. “But in terms of soft power  India has done better than China ” Mr. Jiang said. “Although India’s economy is not as developed  they have put a huge emphasis on promoting their culture  including things like Buddhist traditions and yoga.” China’s anxieties about India are colored to an extent by widespread stereotyping. People here often invoke India as an example for why China  with its even larger population  is not ready for democracy. Some call Indians “a-san ” a derogatory term that was once used to refer to the Sikh guards who worked in Shanghai’s British settlement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In more recent years  the public perception of India has largely been shaped by Chinese state media  which tends to highlight stories on India’s caste system and the treatment of women in Indian society. None None Even today  the word that most often comes up in discussions about India is luan — or chaos. “There’s a perception among Chinese that India is dirty and unsafe ” said Tansen Sen  a history professor at New York University Shanghai. “Even though Indian movies have been popular  Chinese tourists still don’t go to India. They would rather go to Sri Lanka or Nepal.” Indians  for their part  are also less than enthusiastic about China. Ever since 1962  when the two countries engaged in a brief but bloody border war  India has been highly suspicious of China and its intentions. None “The newspapers in India all tend to reinforce the same view ” said Mr. Sen  who was born in India and moved to China at the age of 14. “That is: The Chinese cannot be trusted.” None None None Some have come out in defense of the Chinese film industry  arguing that it is still relatively young. But the discussion around “Dangal” came at a time when many Chinese are expressing concerns that their film industry — in its quest to catch up with Hollywood — has become too narrowly focused on profit and entertainment over quality and substance. “In China  the decisions are made by the people who have money ” said Gu Wancheng  senior vice president at Peacock Mountain Films  which specializes in Chinese and Indian collaborations. “But these people typically don’t have a feeling for a good story. They would rather invest in big stars or special effects.” Perhaps going back to basics and taking lessons from Bollywood  some say  could mitigate that problem. “In Bollywood it’s different ” Ms. Gu added. “People there have the self-confidence to say that ‘we can tell this story well.’” Karoline Kan contributed research.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/arts/design/show-us-your-wall-pete-holmes.html,Where Does Batman Hug the Joker? Ask Pete Holmes Advertisement Supported by Show Us Your Wall None None None He also commissioned a print of lyrics to the Avett Brothers’ “Salvation Song ” and a quotation from Ram Dass  the spiritual and counterculture leader  about self-judgment. It reads in part  “When you go out into the woods and you look at trees  you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent  and some of them are straight  and some of them are evergreens. … And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.” There is also a wooden topographic map of San Francisco — “I enjoy seeing things from above ” Mr. Holmes said in a phone interview. Mr. Holmes dabbles in painting as well. Four years ago  he painted Batman hugging his most reviled nemesis  the Joker  against a yellow backdrop on a large canvas. Mr. Holmes is also a cartoonist and several of his works have appeared in The New Yorker. Batman is of some importance to him — he played the Caped Crusader in 10 parody sketches when he hosted “The Pete Holmes Show” on TBS. The scene of the Batman and Joker détente holds a prime position in Mr. Holmes’s garage. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Why did you pick that Avett Brothers song for a customized print? It kind of sounds like a mission statement for life. When I’m feeling in that good flow that we can all get in  that song makes so much sense to me. I really like the part: “If it compromises truth  then we will go.” It’s the idea that what we’re pursuing isn’t fame and it’s not just money. It’s actually about excavating your soul  sharing and creating. The Ram Dass quotation is interesting. Why did that speak to you? It’s the sort of thing that when you’re having dinner with your family and you are tempted to be driven crazy  and you just want to remember that everyone is doing the best they can. Everyone is doing what is natural to them. The idea of trees bending in a certain way because that’s how they got light is another way of saying that people act a certain way because that’s how they get love. Everybody wants the same fundamental things. They want to feel safe. They want to feel seen and they want to feel loved. So when Ram Dass reminds me to look at people just like other things  it helps me have a bit more compassion. Did you learn how to paint on your own?  It’s not as hard as it looks. I don’t really paint. If you look at it  I draw with paint. People who paint blend colors and they’re mimicking something  like a landscape. I’m just drawing on a canvas with a Sharpie and then I’m painting it in. The fanciest thing I’m doing is painting it yellow  letting it dry  and then painting it yellow. You have more than a passing interest in comic book heroes  correct? I love Batman. He keeps the same hours as a comedian. I think Gotham is so obviously supposed to be New York. So when I was handing out fliers or when I was going to do shows that started at 1 a.m. — talk about metaphors  I literally leaned on the image of Batman to give me strength. Even more than that  I wanted to do a series about reconciliation. So I wanted to do a series of paintings — I still might — of notorious enemies hugging. I wanted to do Lex Luthor and Superman. I wanted to do Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker playing catch in a park like father and son. I love the idea of Batman  who represents right and wrong  and the Joker  who represents death  finding a way to love each other.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/movies/the-lego-batman-movie-review.html,Review: In ‘The Lego Batman Movie ’ Toys and Heroes  What’s Not to Like? Advertisement Supported by None None The cast and crew of “The Lego Batman Movie” sustain that joke admirably  filling in its 104-minute running time with loads of busy action  deadpan humor  visual comedy  reflexive bits and an overfamiliar story line. It features the usual cavalcade of marquee-ready talent (Rosario Dawson  Conan O’Brien  Mariah Carey)  the comic and less so  but owes much of its pleasure and juice to Will Arnett  who voices Batman. The movie puts a goofy spin on the Batman saga  but it squeezes its brightest  most sustained comedy from Mr. Arnett’s hypnotically sepulchral voice  which conveys the entire bat ethos — the Sturm und Drang  the darkness and aloneness  the resoluteness and echoiness — in vocal terms. It’s blissfully self-serious  near-Wagnerian and demented. Mr. Arnett anchors the movie  though he’s nicely book-ended by Michael Cera  as the excitable pip-squeaker Dick Grayson  and Ralph Fiennes  who voices Alfred  Bruce Wayne’s trusted butler and operational aide-de-camp. Some of the wittiest moments happen early  before the story machinery starts humming  and involve Batman-Bruce wandering his mansion in his fetishlike mask and a silky red bathrobe  nuking his lobster dinner and giggling solo at “Jerry Maguire.” If Christopher Nolan’s “Dark Knight” cycle suggests that Batman teeters on actual madness  “The Lego Batman Movie” ups the ante by insinuating that he has fully settled into near-Howard Hughes eccentricity. None As an object  “The Lego Batman Movie” looks as good as its predecessor  “The Lego Movie.” This one is similarly shiny and bright  though sometimes as teasingly dark as Batman. Even when the story drags  which it does as the action grows frenetic  the shiny and bright bits catch the eye. As in the first movie  the character design does much of the most meaningful work because it conveys part of what’s enjoyable about Legos  including their smooth-to-the-touch plastic surfaces and knobby bits (studs in Lego lingo)  which you can almost feel in your hands as you watch. One of the satisfactions of Legos is their touch sensation  a sense memory that’s imprinted on brains  too. None Well  of course not  though that gets to what’s frustrating about these movies  which are so insistently good-natured and relentlessly hyped that it feels almost churlishly old-school raising even modest objections to the fact that — in addition to being  you know  fun — they’re also commercials. It’s not new or news that movies have long sold stuff  including studio tie-ins and toys  as Walt Disney explained by example decades ago  though  like Pixar  he was also in the business of storytelling and not merely corporate-brand storytelling and building. Certainly there are worse things in life and definitely worse movies  including the “Transformers” blockbusters  which sell both toys and war. So  as far as commercials go  “The Lego Batman Movie” is just swell. But because its primary function  outside of making bank  is to extend two brands — Lego and Batman — it can’t help but disappoint. One reason that the first “Lego” movie worked as well as it did is that its novelty and trippier moments conveyed a sense of play and unboundedness  which is part of the appeal of Legos themselves. (It’s the better movie and ad.) The Batman story  by contrast  proves to be a prison  one its creators never escape. They toss around the superstuff and giggle at the legend  but they’re finally confined by the superhero story and its corporate sanctity. It’s a bottom-line bummer.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/arts/sad-day-for-gotham-adam-west-who-played-batman-dies-at-88.html,Sad Day for Gotham: Adam West  Who Played Batman  Dies at 88 Advertisement Supported by None Adam West  the classically handsome baritone actor who turned a comic-book superhero into live-action Pop Art in the 1960s television series “Batman ” died on Friday in Los Angeles. He was 88. The cause was leukemia  according to Molly Schoneveld  a family spokeswoman. “Batman” lasted only two and a half seasons  from January 1966 to March 1968. But the show was such a phenomenon that Mr. West appeared in costume on the cover of Life magazine  the highest tribute to national popularity at the time. The show’s off-kilter camera angles and superimposed dialogue balloons representing fight-scene sound effects like “pow!” and “splat!” were among the elements that led it to be viewed as high camp. Mr. West dismissed that label but proudly described the show as farce. Batman  the crime-fighting alias of Bruce Wayne  a bachelor millionaire in Gotham City  was created as a comic-book character in 1939 by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. (He was soon joined by a young sidekick  Robin the Boy Wonder.) Mr. West’s television version was painfully clean-cut  a milk-drinking model citizen whose reaction to extreme frustration might be  “He’s right  darn it!” Two episodes were broadcast each week for most of the show’s run and featured a number of celebrity guest stars. In addition to well-known villains like the Penguin  played by Burgess Meredith  and the Joker  played by Cesar Romero  visiting stars included Zsa Zsa Gabor  Milton Berle and Liberace. The review of the first episode in The New York Times was qualified  declaring the show “amusing in spots.” Mr. West  it said  had “the jaw  height and sternness for the part.” William West Anderson was born on Sept. 19  1928  in Walla Walla  Wash.  the son of Otto West Anderson  a farmer  and the former Audrey Speer. He moved to Seattle after his parents divorced and his mother remarried. He graduated from Whitman College in Walla Walla and briefly did graduate work at Stanford University. During his two years in the Army  he worked in radio and helped create military television stations. His television career really began when a friend suggested he move to Hawaii to work with him on “The Kini Popo Show ” a live daily variety show. The co-star was a chimpanzee. In Hawaii  he was cast in his first film  “Voodoo Island” (1957)  a zombie-laden horror movie starring Boris Karloff  by 1959  he had been called to Hollywood for a screen test. Before “Batman” came along  Mr. West kept busy with guest roles on television series  including “Perry Mason ” “77 Sunset Strip” and just about every western on television  including “Maverick ” “Bonanza” and “Gunsmoke.” He also appeared in close to a dozen feature films  among them “The Young Philadelphians” (1959)  “Tammy and the Doctor” (1963) and “Robinson Crusoe on Mars” (1964). After “Batman” ended  Mr. West struggled to find meaningful acting jobs because he was so closely identified with his superhero role  but he continued to work in movies and TV  often playing roles that spoofed his Batman character. In later decades  he did a great deal of voice work  including a spectacularly long run (2000-17) on the animated series “Family Guy” as Mayor Adam West  a politician who might best be described as sadistic  corrupt  vacant  clueless and utterly charming. He appeared in a 2011 segment on the website Funny or Die called “Adam West Hits on You … Hard.” And last year he guest-starred on the sitcom “The Big Bang Theory” as himself  hired to appear at a private birthday party where things go wrong. (“I still get paid  don’t I?”) Mr. West married three times and divorced twice. In 1950  in his senior year of college  he married Billie Lou Yeager. They divorced six years later. He married Ngahra Frisbie in the mid-1950s  and their marriage lasted about a decade. In 1971  he married Marcelle Tagand Lear  who survives him  along with their two children  Nina and Perrin West. He is also survived by two children from his second marriage  Jonelle and Hunter Anderson  two stepchildren  five grandchildren  and two great-grandchildren. The popularity of the “Batman” series was international  and fans had long memories. In 2005  Mr. West was interviewed for an article in The Independent of London. At 76  almost 40 years after the end of the TV show  Mr. West said: “What I loved about Batman was his total lack of awareness when it came to his interaction with the outside world. “He actually believed nobody would recognize him on the phone when he was Bruce Wayne  even though he made no attempt to disguise his voice.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,movies
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/28/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-adam-west.html,Adam West Was a Superhero for His Life and Times None None None B. 1928 None None This was the dilemma facing Adam West  the former William West Anderson  as he contemplated becoming TV’s Batman in the fall of 1965. He certainly looked and sounded the part: He was tall  handsome  fit  his voice a Bond-like mix of suave and smarm. He had read the comics himself as a boy growing up on a ranch in the Pacific Northwest. But this Batman was different — not the tortured  noirish character who came to life in 1939  in the shadow of totalitarianism  but rather one who was ready for the colorful  splashy 1960s  the brooding cello replaced by a snappy Motown bass. Batman and his heartthrobby teenage sidekick  Robin  would still be saving Gotham City from archcriminals on a weekly basis. But they’d be doing it with a wink and a nudge  hurling pies as often as punches. Five minutes into reading the initial script  West was giggling. He knew it would be a stretch. But if nothing else  he figured  he could have some fun with the part. He took it. None The show flamed out after three seasons — by the spring of 1968  real-world crises like Vietnam and assassinations and campus unrest were raging  and the Caped Crusaders’ utility belts (that is  the show’s scripts) were coming up empty. West was soon consigned back to the pilot graveyard and  as he feared  was never quite able to shed the cape and cowl. He might have reached a low when  years later  he was shot out of a cannon in his Batsuit. None West lived long enough to see the albatross of the role turn into a medal of honor  he even lent his voice to a few of the subsequent Batman animated series. And he grew philosophical about the character that defined his career. “It’s like ‘Hamlet ’ ” he wrote in “Back to the Batcave.” “When you’re a teenager  you read the play and it’s ‘Hey  I get it! Hamlet’s having a few problems at home and they drive him crazy.’ Twenty years later  you’re not so sure.” But one key to the enduring appeal of Batman  no matter who was playing him  was that  as West wrote  he was a superhero without superpowers  that maybe just by doing your push-ups and your homework  you  too  could accomplish great things. (It didn’t hurt that he was rich.) What West ultimately conveyed in his portrayal  though  was something slightly different: His Batman showed us that occasionally we need our superheroes to be a little more like us. It’s no wonder that when he finally got his next major role  at age 71  on the animated “Family Guy” series  he was a ludicrous  deranged but nevertheless lovable mayor named ... Adam West. Pow! Zap! None B. 1936 None There was a scene that Robert Redford wanted for “Ordinary People” in which Beth Jarrett  played by Mary Tyler Moore  takes a cake out of the refrigerator. The cake has a circle of cherries on top  and the only action in the scene is Beth  the cold  bereaved mother  looking at the cake  adjusting the cherries  then putting the cake back in the fridge. Moore was alone in the kitchen. Redford wanted to capture Beth in an unobserved moment — what was this woman really like? How was she coping with the accidental death of her older son and the recent suicide attempt of her younger son? Had she escaped into her fastidiousness and her uptightness? He shot it once  no good. He shot it again  no good. She tried to bring a motivation to each take: Was this cake good enough? Or  Did the cake need more cherries? And each time he’d say: “No  no  clear your mind. Let’s go again.” Every time the kitchen was set up for another scene  Redford used the opportunity to try the shot again. Moore called it “the bane of the production.” He shot it over and over  26 times in total in front of a “mystified” crew  she wrote in her memoir.

Robbins saw climbing as spiritually exalted — “a game in which we play at acquiring the courage necessary to a beautiful life ” as he once put it. The sport  in his view  should always be a quest for self-understanding  not self-aggrandizement. Climbers who made first ascents should consider themselves artists creating aesthetic pathways for others to follow. The canvas of the great rock walls was finite — there was only so much cliff — so those who claimed a piece of it had a responsibility to climb along natural rock features and minimize the use of permanent safety hardware  like bolts. To ignore that responsibility was to sin against the larger climbing community.

The items varied  but he dubbed this the bottle-shoe-and-plate project  because these were the objects most students chose. Over the semester  the students would draw and redraw them — in different styles  in different media  in different orders — until he was satisfied. While each student worked  he circled the room  clutching his thermos of tea with honey and lemon  peering at their papers. He was known to harangue students for not-perfectly-rounded teacups or loudly harrumph at overdramatically shadowed plates. “You’re in college ” he would chide those who disappointed him. It was a class people cried in. At Connecticut College  a small liberal-arts school that had enough blond heads and Vineyard Vines belts around its arboretum that it looked  on certain days  not unlike a country club  Hendricks was considered “intense.” (I should know.

The animating moment of his early career came in 1952  after a suite of deadly tornadoes tore through Arkansas. Quarantelli was part of a team from the University of Chicago sent to study the aftermath. The conventional wisdom held that survivors would be petrified and helpless but also  somehow  marauding and clobbering one another for food. (“The premise was that people were sheep  except when they were wolves ” as Rebecca Solnit put it in her book about the myths of disaster response.) But after conducting almost 350 interviews in Arkansas  Quarantelli and his colleagues discovered that virtually everyone acted rationally  even generously. They protected one another.

She was profoundly aware of the joys of deaf culture  which demands full face-to-face engagement  as well as the urgency of making basic information accessible to the community. She attended births  trials and presidential inaugurations. She interpreted for Maya Angelou and pro bono for people she met on the street. She wrote that she took in other people’s pain deeply when she translated and struggled to “ventilate her feelings.” She viewed that emotional sensitivity as a liability in her work  until one day it turned out to be an asset. In 1980  she was invited to work with Sweet Honey in the Rock  the internationally acclaimed African-American women’s a cappella ensemble  who perform lush  intricate arrangements of protest songs  wordless chants  spirituals and poems. The group was started in 1973 by Bernice Johnson Reagon  a preacher’s daughter and a founding member of the S.N.C.C. Freedom Singers  which traveled around the country sharing news about the civil rights movement. The church where Reagon grew up in Albany  Ga.  did not have a piano  so she learned her earliest lessons about what music is for and where its power lies by singing unaccompanied  eliminating instruments and paring sound down to just the voice allowed it to unfurl its full range and to join with others more completely.

Axelrod returned to New Jersey with “the largest neons I had ever seen” — and sent some to the curator of fishes at the Smithsonian.

Like Bob Hope before him  Glen Campbell was a victim of a kind of hardening of affect. Even with a public diagnosis of Alzheimer’s trailing him  the genial  middle-of-the-road version of “Glen Campbell” became such a durable commodity that I had to work to remind myself what it felt like to first encounter him. That is  to sit in a college dorm in New York City in 1968  listening to “Wichita Lineman” and feeling as if the voice I heard was laying out a kind of alternative narrative for my own time. In a musical landscape dominated by the Doors  Cream and the Beatles  here was a young Southern boy singing — with unaffected honesty — about something those other groups weren’t paying much attention to: the conflict between work and love. To recall this is to marvel all over again at the wild openness of the musical choices available in the late ’60s. There was no embarrassment in choosing to play “Wichita Lineman” alongside the White Album. Jimmy Webb’s lyrics — “And I need you more than want you/And I want you for all time” — were never exactly cool  but they didn’t need to be. To young men trying to figure out how the emotional landscape of early adulthood was likely to feel  they were a kind of signpost. And the singer interpreting them seemed to have risen directly out of the forlorn places he sang about: Wichita  Galveston  Phoenix. Glen Campbell came across as strangely pure. But purity  when it arrives in an apple-cheeked  all-American form  often bends  unless fiercely protected  to a commercial pressure to become something else. In 1969  Campbell began hosting a TV series  “The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.” Though there was nothing “good time” about the Campbell we were introduced to (his early songs  from “Gentle on My Mind” onward  dealt with one form of sorrow or another) and though Campbell worked  over network objections  to find guest spots for underexposed country singers like Waylon Jennings and Merle Haggard  he seemed to get caught up in what was to become a huge wave. In the late-Vietnam  early-Watergate years  the nation needed a little cheering up  and it fell to a newly revised version of “the South” to provide that. The region  unflatteringly represented since the 1940s by film adaptations of Erskine Caldwell  Tennessee Williams and William Faulkner  got a 1970s makeover. The vision of “Tobacco Road” gave way to the vision of “Hee Haw ” the popular TV series whose corn-pone charm prepared the ground for the advent of the good old boy. Burt Reynolds in “Smokey and the Bandit” and Bo and Luke in “The Dukes of Hazzard” became the smiling standard-bearers of the New South  and the “Glen Campbell” who emerged in that era seemed almost too perfect a fit. In ads for his 1970 film “Norwood ” Campbell was saddled with the moniker “Goodtime Glen.” Read more ▾ B. 1947 None Dr. Joseph Nicolosi wouldn’t take gay for an answer.

A reader’s performance can add further layers of artistry and meaning to a story  and because listeners have their hands and eyes free  they can do something useful while they listen. Being read to while washing dishes  shoveling snow or working out feels like a bonus  a book-lover’s exacta of pleasure and efficiency.

And because you have approximately $11 trillion to spend on special effects in your mind’s eye  you can stage a spectacle in your head that puts to shame anything seen on a TV screen.
