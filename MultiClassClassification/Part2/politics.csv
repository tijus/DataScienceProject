https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/opinion/australia-office-sex-barnaby.html,Can Australia Regulate Intra-Office Sex? Advertisement Supported by None MELBOURNE  Australia — Australian politics these days feels like a story in People magazine. Political journalism  indeed Parliament itself  has been reduced to a forum for rumors about sex. It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce  then deputy prime minister  had been having an affair with an aide  who is now pregnant. Eventually Mr. Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench. But the government’s response to the scandal ensured it would linger on. None This might seem like a straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within a government official’s office. But in truth it has meant that what might have been a footnote in Australian political history has instead set off the degradation of the country’s political culture. A consensual sexual relationship between a minister and a staff member has become a firing offense  like corruption or a conflict of interest. Every rumor of intra-office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament. Sex is now officially a matter of public interest. This could only have a deleterious effect on politics. And sure enough  that’s what has happened. None None But the truth is that the “morals lecture” came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor’s response throughout Mr. Joyce’s travails has been studiously amoral  focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds  or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce’s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash’s comments a politically meaningful smear. The real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It’s that within this new political culture  Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair  and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors  and politicians have a duty to investigate them. None Mr. Turnbull’s attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned. And concern about sex and power in ministers’ offices is utterly reasonable. But we can’t regulate office sexual conduct in a way that doesn’t transform sexual behavior into a matter of public interest. Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means. And that is before we even consider that to impose a ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members. And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances. None None A policy that makes office sex a legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do a major disservice in the long run. Australian politics might have become a little more sensationalistic through all this. And it has gotten a little smaller  too.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/arts/design/italian-art-fondazione-prada-palazzo-strozzi.html,A New Italy  Imagined by Artists and Demagogues Advertisement Supported by Critic’s Notebook None None None “Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage ” it sings  one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions  churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions  and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party  the nationalist project goes right through the history of art. None None Unlike in Germany  where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries  Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state  but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how  in turn  did these artists  many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime  participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography? None A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi  who made a quiet peace with Fascism  appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt  who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy  bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment  and a Roman museum populated by gross  classicized athletes and nymphs. Instead of the false clarity of the white cube  “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural  kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce. You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop  and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror. It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito  or warehouse  where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution  which opened in Rome in 1932  for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show  drawing nearly four million visitors  rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia  Mussolini’s newspaper  gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen ” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light. Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation ” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence  a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum ” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery  where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s. The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella  whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage  found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana  a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato  and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni  whose white bread rolls  rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism. By the late 1960s  the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political  though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome  the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles  when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin  a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble  everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies  and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant  the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”) “Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”)  from 1970  in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses  blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say  the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate  sense-triggering art  and  when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum ” it feels especially baseless. In any event  another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968)  a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling  but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria  and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or  indeed  like the body of Mussolini  hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945. Especially after March 4  as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get  Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again  a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/politics/women-campaign-managers-midterms.html,A Wave of Young Women Running Campaigns (and Changing Politics) Advertisement Supported by None McLEAN  Va. — The campaign manager spoke about her candidate’s race with a veteran’s prepossessing self-assurance. Emma Brown is hiring staff  managing a budget  building out a schedule and studying voter data  block by block  in a Northern Virginia congressional district that will be one of the country’s hardest-contested in November. Her caffeine-fueled days are long — 16 hours is the norm — and so are the odds for her candidate  Lindsey Davis Stover  running in her first race. But Ms. Brown is undeterred. She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a “deeply tactical primary” through “hypercoordination” among events  digital strategy  mail  television and radio. Ms. Brown is only 24. None They will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by men. This year  40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women  according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast  Kelly Dittmar  a political scientist at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics  recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable. “For years  women were the fund-raisers and the communications people ” said Anita Dunn  a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama. “But when it was the big-boy decisions  there weren’t women in the room.” That is changing. Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns. Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown  though in smaller numbers. Becky Alery  31  is managing her first campaign  for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill. “I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way ” she said  including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.” While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job  Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff  volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family  she said. “They think I am insane ” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.” After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine  she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts  talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign  she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism  but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women. “I really revisited my values and thought to myself  I could move to a firm or go in another direction ” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be  I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.” None Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover  a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman  who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock  one of the most vulnerable House Republicans. “I wanted a woman to run our race ” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent  she’s compassionate  she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.” Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.” “We talk a lot about how male managers come in  and there’s this respect ” she said. “Women managers come in  and they have to earn it.” Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age. She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women  in particular  in the Trump era ” Ms. Brown said. Ms. Dittmar  of Rutgers  said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan  drafting a message and a platform.” “The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade ” she said. For now  Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean  Va.  home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night  Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate  coercive  expert  reward and reverent. It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter  the national editor of The Cook Political Report  said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer. “She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time ” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.” Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades  including several on the presidential level  but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule. Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss. “Hillary opened up this space for women ” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won  I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened. I would give my right arm to have won in 2016  but I am really grateful for everything that’s come out of it.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/opinion/islam-feminism-third-way.html,Can Muslim Feminism Find a Third Way? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Ms. Lindsey lives in Rabat  Morocco and co-hosts the BULAQ podcast. None In Muslim countries  laws governing inheritance are derived from verses in the Quran  men generally receive larger  sometimes double  the shares that women get. Distant male relatives can supersede wives  sisters and daughters  leaving women not just bereaved but also destitute. Raising the issue of inheritance and inequality has long been considered blasphemous. When Tunisia’s modernizing first president  Habib Bourguiba  did so in 1974  he was targeted by a fatwa from a Saudi cleric and forced to backtrack. Yet recently  in several North African countries  the debate over equality in inheritance has been picking up steam. Last summer  President Beji Caid Essebsiof Tunisia created a commission to study how to institute an equitable inheritance law. Recently  a couple of thousand demonstrators gathered in downtown Tunis  the capital  to encourage him to follow through. In Morocco  where I live  the National Council on Human Rights in 2015 recommended instituting equality in inheritance  it was browbeaten by Islamists  but the topic hasn’t gone away. None And in January  the Moroccan government took a symbolic but important step: It announced that women would be allowed to become adouls  traditional notaries who witness acts of marriage  divorce and inheritance. Opening this profession to women  Ms. Lamrabet told me at the time  brought women a step closer to equality and to the legal and religious authority from which they have been traditionally excluded across the Muslim Arab world. Ms. Lamrabet is one of a small group of women who have staked a claim to exercising that authority. “Patriarchy is this: to refuse women authority over religious texts ” she told me. “One of our demands is to accept women’s readings of religious texts and let women be religious authorities.” I first met Ms. Lamrabet last fall  in her office at the Mohammedan League of Scholars  a stately building decorated with traditional stucco molding  tiles and wooden latticework. The league is Morocco’s pre-eminent official institution of religious scholarship  and Ms. Lamrabet’s presence within it was in and of itself remarkable. None When Ms. Lamrabet rejects practices such as polygamy  unequal access to divorce or a husband’s authority over his wife  she either shows there is no textual basis at all in the Quran for these practices  or she argues that the historical context needs to be taken into account when interpreting what the text says. With regard to inheritance  Ms. Lamrabet and others note that women were allotted a smaller share on the assumption that male relatives would provide for all their material needs. That is no longer the case  many households in Morocco today depend largely on a woman’s income. So Ms. Lamrabet argues that the law should be re-evaluated on the basis of the Quran’s original spirit of justice and fairness. But apparently making this argument  repeatedly and publicly  was too much for the religious establishment in Morocco. Ms. Lamrabet says her goal is the “deconstruction of religious patriarchy.” She argues from a religious basis because  she told me  religion is the No. 1 weapon used against women in her country today. She wants to furnish women with arguments with which to reclaim their religion  and to reject inequality and discrimination in the name of Islam. But she is also critical of the way women’s rights have been deployed by Western powers to justify colonialism  military intervention and attacks on her religion. Her arguments will displease both Muslim conservatives who see feminism as an immoral  unnecessary foreign import and those who believe women’s subjugation is a unique and unchangeable feature of Islam. Ms. Lamrabet is part of a school of thought often referred to as “Islamic feminism” — which includes the late  great Moroccan sociologist Fatema Mernissi and scholars such as Amina Wadud and Leila Ahmed. She is also part of a larger field of activists  artists and intellectuals trying to articulate a feminist third way — one that doesn’t have to choose between religion and universal rights  between critiquing the West and kowtowing to local conservatives. The broaching of inheritance reform — which would be a truly revolutionary change — is taking place as a number of Arab countries are giving women new legal rights. In Tunisia  Muslim women will be allowed to marry non-Muslim men (in most Muslim countries only men are allowed to marry outside their religion). Lebanon is the latest country in the region to outlaw the practice of rapists being exonerated for their crime by marrying their victims. Even in Saudi Arabia  the authorities have announced that women will finally be granted the right to drive  as well as to set up their own businesses without a male guardian’s consent. Skepticism over these announcements is sometimes warranted. Male rulers and autocrats in the region have figured out that branding themselves champions of women’s rights is a winning P.R. move in the West — but even “enlightened” rulers are unlikely to undermine a religious discourse from which they derive much of their own legitimacy. And legal reforms that favor women are only as strong as the rule of law over all. Even as we celebrate every gain that makes women’s lives better  what counts most is the degree to which women are able to voice and to advance their own arguments for equality. None The debate over women’s rights and Islam is so politicized and riddled with stereotypes that it is extremely hard to write about. Muslim women are not all victims  renegades or standard-bearers for religious or cultural authenticity. They are not foils with which to bash Islam or through which sympathetic Westerners can congratulate themselves on their cultural superiority. True solidarity with women in this part of the world means paying less attention to self-serving male rulers and to cosmetic official initiatives and more to the lively  often contentious debate taking place within Muslim societies  to the diverse voices of women here and to their ideas of how they want to advance their own cause. These voices are secular and religious  young and old  they are also often critical of Western policies in the region. Inheritance inequality  Ms. Lamrabet told me  is part of an ideology that assumes that women are worth less and deserve less. She and others will continue to insist that women get their fair share.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/us/politics/primary-results-west-virginia-ohio.html,6 Takeaways From Tuesday’s Primary Elections Advertisement Supported by None Primary elections in four Republican-leaning states rattled Congress on Tuesday night  as voters ejected a sitting member of the House and set up intense campaigns for the Senate in several battlegrounds. None None Voters nearly always dislike Congress  but Tuesday was a vivid illustration of just how toxic the taint of Washington may be in 2018. The night was a near-wipeout for members of the House seeking higher office. Three Republican lawmakers lost campaigns for the Senate: Luke Messer and Todd Rokita in Indiana  and Evan Jenkins in West Virginia. A fourth  James B. Renacci of Ohio  won the Senate nomination but drew less than half the primary vote despite facing relatively unknown opponents and campaigning with President Trump’s loud support. None A populist-oriented swing state that Mr. Trump won easily in 2016  Ohio could have been welcoming ground for fiery rebels on the left and the right. But Trumpian politics fizzled in several important primaries  and voters chose a thoroughly conventional pair of candidates for governor in Mike DeWine  a Republican  and Richard Cordray  a Democrat. None None But the failure of insurgents in both parties may signal that this quintessential Midwestern swing state has not yet been remade in the president’s image. Senator Manchin  a conservative-leaning Democrat  has led a relatively charmed political life  twice winning races for governor and for the seat he holds now. But West Virginia continues to drift from its New Deal Democrat roots  and Mr. Manchin may face the most difficult race of his career. None None None Also worrisome for Mr. Manchin were the number of Democratic voters who supported his primary opponent  who ran a nominal campaign. He lost about 30 percent of the vote and did even worse in some of the state’s coal counties  which are full of the sort of ancestral Democrats he will need to hold onto in November. None Voters seemed to listen: The controversial coal baron finished third in what was largely a three-person race  taking just 20 percent of the vote. Less immediately consequential  but still significant  was the role Democrats played in the state’s Republican primary  as a liberal super PAC linked to Washington strategists aggressively attacked Representative Jenkins. They feared that the Democrat-turned-Republican with a base in the state’s coal counties would be the strongest candidate against Mr. Manchin  and they wound up helping lift Mr. Morrisey to the nomination. None None None None When Mr. Trump won the presidency  the Republican Party was fractured and important conservative leaders still opposed him. On Tuesday  not one Trump critic won a Republican primary. The major Republican candidates cast themselves as Trump allies and in some cases explicitly invoked him as a role model. In Indiana  Mike Braun  a wealthy former state legislator  won the Republican Senate primary by branding himself as a Trump-like businessman and outsider. In Ohio  Mr. Renacci won the Senate primary with Mr. Trump’s endorsement. And Mr. Trump’s opposition to Mr. Blankenship in West Virginia may have helped doom him. Even the more traditional Republicans mimicked Mr. Trump: Mr. DeWine’s campaign accused his primary opponent  Mary Taylor  of failing to back the president sufficiently in 2016. At one point  while attacking Ms. Taylor’s ethics  the DeWine camp tweeted #LockHerUp. And Ms. Taylor  Ohio’s lieutenant governor  attempted political contortions to campaign as a Trump loyalist without disavowing the current governor  John Kasich  a Republican who is a fierce Trump critic. Republicans may be more careful about embracing Mr. Trump in bluer states. So far  though  they are assembling a 2018 slate tied closely to him in every important race.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/opinion/sotu-viewers-guide-trump.html,A Viewer’s Guide to Donald Trump Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None For the past three years  I have spent the majority of my days moving through the world doing an impression of Donald Trump. I have coifed  combed and caressed a gravity-defying pompadour  teetered over my own midsection in a Pisa-like lean and narrowed my eyes into a leering squint. Most of the time  I did this on Comedy Central’s “The President Show ” and I hope I don’t sound too much like my avatar when I say I portray both his body and his mind with relative accuracy. I’ve studied our president’s bizarrely lyrical speech patterns and his unconsciously betraying body movements. I have learned that he is speaking with his body language as much as he is with his mouth. As you prepare to watch our 45th president deliver his first State of the Union on Tuesday night  you can refer to this primer as a means of reconciling his body language and speech patterns. It should provide insight into what the president is really saying. When the sergeant-at-arms barks our president into the House chamber  I can promise you that Mr. Trump’s mind is mostly focused on getting down the slight slope leading toward the podium. I’ve watched hundreds of hours of him managing inclines and declines and even after 70-plus years on the planet  he still struggles with that. He never seems particularly steady  and I’ll leave you to make the associations between his instability and his lack of a moral center. While most presidents take this opportunity to glad-hand members of Congress  in similar situations  Mr. Trump uses people as a hand railing. This creates a deep conflict between his desire to not fall down and his germophobic tendencies that no doubt contributes to his discomfort. This is a combination of the physical and mental. The president is obviously aware that he’s being observed  but his insecurity over his lack of total control regarding how he’s perceived translates into muttering and self-effacing glances to anyone in his line of sight. His face usually reads: “Can you believe this? ” “I hope I make it up these stairs ” “Mike  help me get up the stairs for Christ’s sake!” Mr. Trump’s instinct is to pad all experiences with a sense of pre-embarrassment so that he can exert more control if something unexpected happens. In short  the mantra behind everything he does is  “I meant to do that!” This was the first and most important physical trait I perfected in playing Mr. Trump. He pitches forward on the balls of his feet  his hands curled and locked at his waist. It is his most relaxed standing position. If you place him in a church with a choir  his lean turns into something resembling swaying — he’ll move back and forth to the music with marionette arms lifelessly swinging somewhat like pig carcasses in a meat freezer. The most likely time to see the Trump Lean™ is right before he’s announced into the chamber  or before he turns to stand at the lectern. Donald Trump doesn’t like to turn his head. Instead  he turns his entire upper body and shoulders  leaning his head forward like a pigeon eyeing stale bread crust. He obviously wants to stabilize himself at the lectern for fear of falling over  and his rigid upper body is like that of a litigious courtroom charlatan strapped in a neck brace checking to see if people believe him. President Trump reads from a teleprompter in the cadence of a grandmother reading “Goodnight Moon.” He rarely seems familiar with the material. If he likes a line or idea in the speech  he’ll take a moment to repeat it and savor it — it’s as if he’s hearing it for the first time  because it’s the first time he’s reading it. Like Bugs Bunny conducting an orchestra  Mr. Trump conducts many of his statements too. The open palm is a plea to his audience to connect with his plight. The O.K. symbol is reserved for telling specific lies. The thumbs-up-moving-into-a-flat-palm is used to cover dead space — either during cheering or when he’s interrupted by protesters. Many liberal analysts have interpreted the president’s wandering speech patterns as a sign of dementia or stupidity  or even as some sort of folksy  working-class vernacular. But those views are mistaken. The president is simply speaking to himself. The audience is a bystander to this outward internal dialogue. When he discovers a particularly interesting phrase or concept  he will repeat it  building his idea in front of you. “Believe me” is part guarantee and part buttress to a falsehood. While studying Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign  I realized that his greatest asset lay in his ability to make his story his followers’ story as well. He began nearly every rally reminding viewers that there were 17 Republican primary candidates  that he came in second in Iowa  first in New Hampshire and “beat them all.” He still repeats this from time to time. Mr. Trump hides in plain sight  saying with his body exactly what he’s going to do and how he’s going to do it. His movements are rooted in his physical insecurity. While he wears a “tough guy” mask  his movements have the quality of an old dowager who has taken the carriage into town to mix with the common people. How can this help you when you listen to him? Just remember: Every day is opposite day with the president. When he says something isn’t true  it probably is. No matter what he’s saying  his body is telling the world  “I’m pretending  I’m scared and I’m totally unprepared.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/opinion/sunday/donald-trump-evangelicals-president.html,In Donald Trump  Evangelicals Have Found Their President Advertisement Supported by Opinion None Last August  President Trump sat behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and looked me straight in the eyes. With a look of reflection and purposefulness  he discussed his upbringing and fondly recalled a vivid childhood memory from the 1950s: watching Billy Graham sermons on television with his father. “My father was a fan of Billy Graham ” the president said. He recalled how his father  Fred  attended the historic 1957 New York City Crusade. Mr. Graham  who died last week at 99  brought both evangelism and evangelicalism into the mainstream of American culture. Meanwhile  young Donald grew to be successful  wealthy and famous — culminating with his becoming the leader of the free world. In the process  he too brought evangelicals somewhere  a place so many would have never imagined: an embrace of Donald Trump. Of all the questions surrounding the current president  perhaps the most perplexing is this: How could evangelicals get behind a man like Mr. Trump  especially well-known conservative leaders who both treasure and champion morality? Constant news reports paint a picture of an out-of-control  angry  mentally unstable  reckless president who is prejudiced against all of humanity except white people with modest incomes and out-of-date values. But after interviewing scores of evangelical leaders  I have developed a different perspective. Most of the world  and even most reporters  know only the public side of President Trump. In private  evangelical leaders have come to recognize a more compassionate side. For example  Mr. Trump took a car ride with Mike Pence along with Billy Graham’s son Franklin and Tony Perkins  a leading figure on the Christian right  during the Louisiana floods of 2016. Impressed by what Franklin Graham’s Christian ministry had done for flood victims  Mr. Trump told him that he was writing it a six-figure check  which Mr. Graham told him to send to Mr. Perkins’s church. Both men were moved by his impulsive kindness  and a bond was formed. Another story involves Mr. Trump and the televangelist James Robison praying together inside an S.U.V. on the airport tarmac in Panama City  Fla.  during a campaign stop. When Mr. Trump exited the car  he gave Mr. Robison a hug  pulled him up against his chest firmly and said  “Man  I sure love you.” A small gesture  perhaps  but heartfelt  real and so unlike the caricature of the president most of us see. And practically every evangelical leader I interviewed has a similar story. Critics say that the Trump-evangelical relationship is transactional  that they support him to see their agenda carried out. In fact  evangelicals take the long view on Mr. Trump  they afford him grace when he doesn’t deserve it. Few dispute that Mr. Trump may need a little more grace than others. But evangelicals truly do believe that all people are flawed  and yet Christ offers them grace. Shouldn’t they do the same for the president? This is more than a biblical mandate. The Bible is replete with examples of flawed individuals being used to accomplish God’s will. Evangelicals I interviewed said they believed that Mr. Trump was in the White House for a reason. Bishop Wayne Jackson  who is the pastor of Great Faith Ministries International in Detroit and calls himself a lifelong Democrat  remembers Mr. Trump’s campaign visit to his church. He told me that the moment Mr. Trump got out of the car  “the spirit of the Lord told me that that’s the next president of the United States.” Evangelical leaders also see a civic obligation to speak godly counsel to him  on policy and personal matters. He is  after all  the president. And it’s paying off. I’ve watched Mr. Trump through the lens of the faith community for years  and he has delivered the policy goods and is progressing on the spiritual ones. My reporting suggests Donald Trump is on a spiritual voyage that has accelerated in recent years  thanks to evangelicals who have employed the biblical mandate of sharing and showing God’s love to him rather than shunning him. President Trump told me that he “was exposed to a lot of people  from a religious standpoint  that I would’ve never met before. And so it has had an impact on me.” This president’s effect on our cultural norms has been shocking. His critics would call it appalling  evangelicals say it’s immensely satisfying: They’ve seen a culture deteriorate quickly in the past decade  and they’re looking for a bold culture warrior to fight for them. Showing that God does indeed have a sense of humor  He gave them Mr. Trump. Yet in God’s perfection  it’s a match made in heaven. Mr. Trump and evangelicals share a disdain for political correctness  a world seen through absolutes and a desire to see an America that embraces Judeo-Christian values again rather than rejecting them. Finally  why in the world wouldn’t evangelicals get behind and support a man who not only is in line with most of their agenda but also has delivered time and time again? The victories are numerous: the courts  pro-life policies  the coming Embassy in Jerusalem and religious liberty issues  just to name a few. He easily wins the unofficial label of “most evangelical-friendly United States president ever.” Does Mr. Trump have moral failings? Yes. Critics will suggest a hypocrisy coming from evangelical leaders who are quick to denounce the ethical failings of others who don’t have an “R” next to their name. But the goal of evangelicals has always been winning the larger battle over control of the culture  not to get mired in the moral failings of each and every candidate. For evangelicals  voting in the macro is the moral thing to do  even if the candidate is morally flawed. Evangelicals have tried the “moral” candidate before. Jimmy Carter was once the evangelical candidate. How did that work out in the macro? George W. Bush was the evangelical candidate in 2000: He pushed traditional conservative policies  but he doesn’t come close to Mr. Trump’s courageous blunt strokes in defense of evangelicals. Evangelicals have found their man. It may seem mystifying to outsiders  but for someone like me  with a front-row seat to an inside view  it makes perfect sense. Maybe they’re taking their cue from Billy Graham  embracing presidents with moral failings rather than rejecting them. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/opinion/trump-economy-credit.html,It’s Trump’s Economy Now Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None If you can  put aside for a moment your opinion of Donald Trump’s words and actions and let’s be perfectly honest: One year into his presidency  could the economy be any rosier? None None Then there is the cheerful news for the Rust Belt areas of the country: Blue-collar manufacturing  construction and mining jobs have risen by almost half a million in just one year. None None None Admittedly  these are short-term trends  based on just one year of Mr. Trump’s term. If I’ve learned anything as an economic analyst  it is that the stock market and economic winds can shift by the hour. But for now  it’s hard to see many dark clouds on the horizon. They will come  of course  as they do for almost every president. But few presidents can claim to have presided over the kind of economy the United States is enjoying now. And surely the primal screams from both the right and left that President Trump would ruin the economy now seem hysterical. So who gets the credit for this surge? Most voters say President Obama — and  sure  he gets some because corporate balance sheets were healthy when Mr. Trump entered office. But there are several holes in this theory. For one  the economy was decelerating at the end of the Obama presidency  with the annual growth rate falling to an anemic 1.6 percent in 2016  and many economists warned of a recession. If Mr. Trump had continued Mr. Obama’s policies  one might not credit him for today’s strong economy. But Mr. Trump has begun to systematically overturn Obama policies on taxes  regulations  energy  climate change  net neutrality  budget priorities and health care — as well as replacing Janet Yellen as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve. Trumponomics is Obamanomics in reverse. In the first 18 months of the Reagan presidency  the economy plummeted and the president’s liberal critics triumphantly declared Reaganomics a failure. But by late 1982  with Reagan’s phased-in tax cuts finally kicking in  the economy exploded and quarterly growth rates hit 8 percent  job creation soared and Reagan won re-election in a 49-state landslide. If the economy had nose-dived in 2017  there’s no doubt the media would have pounced on Trump policies as disgraceful failures. But with the economy red-hot  he gets little credit. That’s a double standard. Ultimately  the most important statistical indicator for Mr. Trump will be wages for middle-income workers. They’ve been flat in real terms for 15 years  which more than anything explains the populist rebellion in 2016. So far  wages and salaries haven’t bumped up much  but we are betting that the tax cut will bring increased investment and a supertight job market with intense competition for workers leading to higher pay. This is already starting to happen at Walmart and other companies  and in fast-growing cities like Nashville and San Francisco. If those wages go up  Mr. Trump may not get credit from the news media or Democrats  but it’s a good bet he will get re-elected.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/opinion/trump-nuclear-weapons-mental-health.html,Would the Air Force Let Airman Trump Near a Nuclear Weapon? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None As a psychiatrist for the United States Air Force  one of my responsibilities was evaluating the mental stability of airmen who handled nuclear weapons  using the standards laid out in what is called the Nuclear Personnel Reliability Program. There is no need to justify why our military would take every precaution necessary to ensure that the men and women in uniform handling nuclear weapons were fit to do so  whether they were in charge of a missile silo or loading nuclear bombs onto aircraft — or giving the orders to them  on up the chain of command. Strangely  the commander-in-chief  the one who would decide when and how to use those weapons  is the only individual in the chain who is not subject to the ongoing certification under the program. None On Tuesday the White House physician  Rear Admiral Ronny Jackson  gave the president a clean bill of health. And no doubt  by many standards  Mr. Trump is in decent shape. But the standards for a person’s physical and mental health are a different matter from his fitness to oversee our nuclear arsenal. What if President Trump were  instead  Airman Trump  and was to be assessed under the program’s guidelines  would I certify him as “P.R.P. ready” to work in the vicinity of nuclear weapons? I have not had the opportunity to examine the president personally  but warning signs abound. What if I had reliable outside information that Airman Trump displayed erratic emotions? That I saw very clearly that he was engaging in cyberbullying on Twitter? That he had repeatedly made untruthful or highly distorted statements? That his language implied he engaged in sexually abusive behavior? That he appeared paranoid about being surveilled or persecuted by others  that he frequently disregarded or violated the rights of others? These are the sorts of things that set off alarms for Air Force psychiatrists. I certainly could not certify him as “P.R.P. ready” without more extensive psychological evaluation. It does not take a former Air Force psychiatrist to point out that our country finds itself in a place unlike any we’ve ever been before. Saturday morning’s alarm in Hawaii  as residents read alerts that incoming ballistic missiles were on their way  is a wakeup call to the very real danger we’re facing. Global tension and angst are significantly heightened. We’ve been here a few times before  but unlike those other times our commander-in-chief adds  without equivocation  to this angst almost daily with his words and actions. We have always assumed that the person at the top has the mental fitness to meet whatever standards the Air Force set for the rest of the chain of command. What keeps me up at night? The realization that  at the worst possible time  we have a chief executive who I believe would probably fail the P.R.P. The topic of presidential fitness and cognitive decline has always been a legitimate issue. The ability for the Executive Office to function effectively and without exposing the American people to undue danger relies on the mental faculties of the one person inhabiting its walls. Former President Jimmy Carter pointed this out in an article he wrote for The Journal of the American Medical Association in 1994  in which he warned that our country is in “continuing danger” from the possibility that a president could become disabled “particularly by a neurological illness.” Revelations that President Ronald Reagan may have had early-stage Alzheimer’s while he was president add to these concerns. It’s unlikely that the military will act on its own to require the president to submit to an Air Force psychiatrist’s evaluation. But there are other options. A bill in the House  with support in the Senate  called the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017  explicitly prevents any president from initiating a nuclear first strike without Congressional approval. This should be common sense for any politician to support  because it assures that the checks and balances intended by the framers of the Constitution remain intact. But equally important  it remedies a glaring failure within the nuclear chain of command and mitigates one of the greatest dangers of our nuclear ages: the possibility of an unhinged president executing a calamitous decision that endangers millions of Americans  and potentially millions of others around the globe. No president  including Mr. Trump  should have the unilateral power to begin a nuclear war. Congress must protect the American people  and taking away the option of an impulsive first strike nuclear attack is a clear and sane way to prevent a dangerous and insane result.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/nyregion/trump-place-name-nyc.html,Trump Place Does Not Have to Be a Forever Name  Judge Says Advertisement Supported by None Over the opposition of lawyers for a company owned by President Donald J. Trump  State Supreme Court Judge Eileen Bransten ruled Thursday that a condominium on the Upper West Side could remove the bronze letters spelling out his name from its 46-story building. None Reading a 12-page document from the bench  Judge Bransten repeatedly rejected  dismissed or found the Trump lawyers’ arguments to be unpersuasive and granted summary judgment to the condominium’s board. The ruling came in response to a request in January by the board  asking the judge to declare that a licensing agreement between the building and DJT Holdings  one of Mr. Trump’s companies  that gave the condo the right to use the Trump name on its facade  did not require it to use the name. After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016  a straw poll of building residents found that two-thirds of the 253 condo owners who participated wanted to remove the name  while 23 percent wanted to keep it. But a lawyer for a Trump subsidiary sent a letter promising to file suit if the board took any action. In the letter  Mr. Trump’s lawyer  Alan Garten  said that if the condo made any effort to remove the Trump lettering  Mr. Trump would “commence appropriate legal proceedings to not only prevent such unauthorized action  but to also recover the significant amount of damages  costs and attorney’s fees.” That was no small matter in the minds of many condo owners. Mr. Trump has a reputation as a vigorous if not always victorious plaintiff and defendant whose determination to drag out a court fight could cost a fortune. Mr. Trump  for instance  spent 15 years fending off a class-action lawsuit over the use of 200 undocumented Polish workers at his first signature luxury building  Trump Tower. He settled the matter in 1998 in a once secret settlement in which his opponents essentially got everything they had originally asked for  $1.375 million. Mr. Trump  however  did not admit any wrongdoing. And the battle over the T-R-U-M-P letters at 200 Riverside may not be over. Amanda Miller  a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization  called the judge’s decision both “unprecedented” and “limited to a technical issue.” In a sign that the Trump Organization will challenge Judge Bransten’s ruling  Ms. Miller said the company was “confident that the appeals court will conclude otherwise.” Marti Frucci  a resident of 200 Riverside who rents her apartment from the owner  said she is following the debate closely because she may buy an apartment there in the future. “I don’t think it adds anything to the building ” she said of the Trump brand. “There are a lot of us who cringe when people associate the building with his name.” Still  some residents are concerned about being ensnared in costly and lengthy litigation. “I would rather the building spend money on a long gestating renovation project than this litigation ” said the longtime resident who asked for anonymity because feelings are running hot in the building. The March 2000 licensing agreement was made in the early days of Mr. Trump’s effort to establish the Trump brand. The agreement identified Mr. Trump in the first sentence as a “worldwide renowned builder and developer of real estate who enjoys the highest reputation in these fields among others.” And it granted the condominium owners the continued use of the Trump name for $1  forever. The Trump lawyers have argued in court papers that the consideration that flowed to Mr. Trump was not simply a single dollar  but rather the “assurance” that the building would be named Trump Place “in perpetuity.” Judge Bransten  following in the path of federal judges who have recently confounded Mr. Trump in court on immigration issues  found that the four-page licensing agreement between Mr. Trump and the condominium gave the condo permission to use the Trump name but in no way requires the owner to use it. Therefore  nothing prevents the board from taking it off the building. The board plans to conduct a formal vote of owners to decide the matter. The board has estimated that it would cost about $19 000 to remove the letters and another $23 000 to wash the facade of the building afterward. None None None But the Trump company had apparently hoped to stem the tide at 200 Riverside. Outside the courtroom  Lawrence S. Rosen  a lawyer for Mr. Trump said of the judge  “she got it wrong but we respect her decision.” He insisted that removal of the signage would require approval by two thirds of the condo owners  rather than a simple majority  an issue Judge Bransten did not address. Further  Mr. Rosen said that residents in the past had seen the Trump brand as valuable  something they were willing to pay for. The licensing document was signed in 2000 by Mr. Trump and Paul Davis  president of the board of managers at 200 Riverside. But Mr. Davis did not own a condo in the building. He was chief executive of Hudson Waterfront Associates  a company created by the Hong Kong billionaires who owned the land on which the project was being built and oversaw the development. Harry Lipman  a lawyer for the condo board  said  “We’re pleased  obviously ” but declined further comment. None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/opinion/trump-needs-to-be-more-trumpian-in-syria.html,Trump Needs to Be More Trumpian in Syria Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Doran was a senior director at the National Security Council in the George W. Bush administration. The United States will be making an exit from Syria “very soon ” President Trump said late last month in Ohio. “Let the other people take care of it now.” In making this announcement  the president ignored a cardinal principle of an author he holds in very high regard: himself. According to “The Art of the Deal ” Mr. Trump’s 1987 best-selling guide to business strategy  success in negotiations requires developing leverage. The crux of the matter is appearing unflappable while making the other guy sweat. “The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it ” Mr. Trump wrote. “That makes the other guy smell blood  and then you’re dead.” Mr. Trump’s Syria announcement fostered the impression of a president desperate to get out of the Middle East. It also violated another oft-repeated Trumpian principle: never  ever telegraph your military moves. “I don’t want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is ” Mr. Trump said during the 2016 presidential campaign. The announcement generated considerable unease in the foreign policy establishment. Senator John McCain  among others  claimed that Mr. Trump’s call for a withdrawal emboldened Bashar al-Assad  convincing him he could launch a chemical weapons attack a mere 10 days later. The claim is speculative  but not outrageous. Mr. Assad has a strong imperative to clear insurgents from eastern Ghouta  the stronghold of the most formidable Damascus-based militia. Believing that the United States was headed for the exits may have made him even more willing to hold back nothing. Mr. Trump probably assumed that his announcement would spur America’s allies like Israel  and  especially  Saudi Arabia to step up. That tactic is dangerous. If allies conclude that an American departure is inevitable  they will hedge their bets. Some will lie low. Others will make a beeline to Vladimir Putin. Russia  they know  will never quit Syria. Washington  someone once said  might be indispensable  but Moscow is immovable. After the departure of American troops  Mr. Putin’s first goal will be to sever the bonds that tie Turkey to NATO. His preferred method will be to supplant the United States as the primary interlocutor between the Syrian Kurds and the Turks. Deprived of direct American support  the Kurds will inevitably turn to Moscow  the sole available source of protection from Turkey. Mr. Putin will welcome them with open arms to gain leverage — there’s that word again — over Ankara. Moscow will demand from Ankara that it distance itself from the West or face a Russian policy supportive of a maximalist Kurdish agenda. Many in Washington have adopted a blasé attitude about this prospect. They argue that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey is lost to the West. This is a monumental failure of the imagination. The damage that a truly hostile Turkey can do is far worse than anything we have seen so far. And the key to managing relations with Turkey is maintaining primacy in the Turkish-Kurdish arena — a status that will disappear the moment American troops leave Syria. A precipitous departure will also cede leverage to Iran at the very moment when United States-Iranian conflict is set to escalate. On May 12  Mr. Trump may well decide to reimpose nuclear sanctions on the Islamic Republic. Restructuring the nuclear deal to American specifications requires convincing Iran’s supreme leader  Ali Khamenei  that America is resolute in its determination to pare down the Iranian nuclear program. Retreating from Syria will foster the opposite impression. Mr. Trump should be thinking instead of exploiting Iranian weaknesses. Here the Israelis are the key. Their attack on Monday on an Iranian base in the Syrian desert is striking not just for the military and intelligence capabilities it demonstrated but also for the defiance of Mr. Putin. Boldness and ability of this magnitude in an ally is a four-star asset that Mr. Trump’s Mideast policy has so far failed to exploit. Imagine if Washington and Jerusalem were to develop a joint military plan designed to contain and degrade Iranian forces in Syria. Even a limited American military commitment to a coordinated United States-Israeli strategy would immediately change the balance of power on the ground. It would most likely engender more diplomatic cooperation from Mr. Putin while sending a powerful message to Tehran about the necessity of respecting American demands regarding its nuclear program. Going forward  Mr. Trump should stick to his campaign promise and keep mum about his plans. Meantime  he should reconsider his intention to withdraw. As it is  the United States has a small footprint in Syria — an estimated 2 000 troops. The right strategy could reduce those numbers further while gaining even more of that precious commodity over Iran and Russia: leverage.

In 2015  his reputation for policy-oriented nerdiness got him the chairmanship of the powerful Ways and Means Committee  where he was supposed to reform the nation’s entire fiscal regime with a superhuman knowledge of both the details and the substance of the nation’s finances. He didn’t. Undaunted  Mr. Ryan took the speaker’s chair later that year after playing Hamlet and claiming implausibly that he didn’t want the job and would accept it only if Republicans thrust it upon him. He promised fidelity to the conservative catechism and a return to budget sanity  but he didn’t follow through. His fecklessness led the Tea Party base that had swept him and his colleagues to power to grow even more disenchanted with the Republican congressional leadership. For seven years  the leadership raised countless millions of dollars and won first the House  then the Senate  and finally the presidency  in part by promising to repeal Obamacare. Nothing was more central to Republican identity between 2010 and the rise of President Trump. But when given the chance  Mr. Ryan couldn’t get the House to pass repeal. The bill the House finally sent to the Senate wasn’t a repeal but a dilution. It never became law  either. Likewise  Mr. Ryan  a longtime budget hawk  was incapable of returning the House budget process to regular order. And rather than reducing spending and the deficit  he increased both. Worse  Mr. Ryan is at odds with the president and a majority in his party on immigration and border control. The bill for those contradictions and failures has finally come due. None Intellectually and politically  Mr. Ryan is part of the Reagan Revolution’s third generation. And as it is with many entrepreneurial families  it is the third generation that squanders the family fortune. They don’t know how it was created  and in their own lives they have known nothing but wealth. Reaganism remains a rich legacy  but Republicans can’t live off the interest. The predictable response from Democrats will be that Mr. Ryan couldn’t square his principles with the reality of Mr. Trump’s presidency. That might score a quick rhetorical win  but it misses the bigger political picture. America is in the midst of a major political realignment that is redefining both the left and the right. Mr. Trump’s sudden ascendance to power is a symptom of the larger trend and also a catalyst for the intellectual and political reformation that is currently underway on the right  which has led to the announced departures of standard bearers of the ancien régime like Senator Jeff Flake  Senator Bob Corker and now Mr. Ryan. The job for House Republicans will be to select a new leader who isn’t just more of the same. The last effective leader was Newt Gingrich. Since he stepped down in 1999  Republican leadership has been either corrupt or incompetent. Tom DeLay was indicted (although he was eventually acquitted)  Dennis Hastert is a convicted felon. John Boehner was a do-nothing placeholder who now works for a marijuana company  and Eric Cantor so infuriated his own constituents that he was defeated by an underfunded economics professor who still holds the seat. What we need is a clean break with the time-markers and careerists who are content being the party of no. None Mr. Ryan’s legacy will be one of lost opportunities and youthful promise unfulfilled. He’s left a mess that his successor will have to clean up. House Republicans under Mr. Ryan became a disorganized rabble rather than the energetic and effective conference confidently enacting the agenda that one would expect from a party that controls both houses of Congress and the presidency. Republicans need a leader who is in step with the president and his agenda  one who emphasizes pro-citizen immigration policies  pro-worker economic policies and an America First national security policy that is circumspect about foreign military intervention. Equally important  the next leader must be someone who commands the respect and obedience of the conference. Voters gave Republicans power because they believed that the policies the party promised offered them a better future. Republicans must repay that trust with action. Just as Moses couldn’t enter the promised land because he had broken faith with God  much of the current House leadership has broken faith with its voters. House Republicans need to find their Joshua — a leader who sees the party’s future and can bring its members together to build it. Ambitious politicians are always willing  but who’s ready?

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/arts/design/obama-portrait.html,Obama Portraits Blend Paint and Politics  and Fact and Fiction Advertisement Supported by Critic’s Notebook None None Ordinarily  the event would pass barely noticed in the worlds of politics and art. Yes  the Portrait Gallery  part of the Smithsonian Institution  owns the only readily accessible complete collection of presidential likenesses. But recently commissioned additions to the collection have been so undistinguished that the tradition of installing a new portrait after a leader has left office is now little more than ceremonial routine. None None It doesn’t take #BlackLivesMatter consciousness to see the significance of this racial lineup within the national story as told by the Portrait Gallery. Some of the earliest presidents represented — George Washington  Thomas Jefferson — were slaveholders  Mrs. Obama’s great-great grandparents were slaves. And today we’re seeing more and more evidence that the social gains of the civil rights  and Black Power  and Obama eras are  with a vengeance  being rolled back. None The National Portrait Gallery collection isn’t old. It was created by an Act of Congress in 1962 and opened to the public in 1968. (The Obama unveiling is billed as part of its 50th birthday celebrations.) By the time it began collecting  many chief executive portraits of note were already housed elsewhere. (The collection of first lady portraits is still incomplete  commissioning new ones started only in 2006.) None None None None Mr. Obama has much better luck with his similarly high-profile portraitist. Mr. Wiley  born in Los Angeles in 1977  gained a following in the early 2000s with his crisp  glossy  life-size paintings of young African-American men dressed in hip-hop styles  but depicted in the old-master manner of European royal portraits. More recently he has expanded his repertoire to include female subjects  as well as models from Brazil  India  Nigeria and Senegal  creating the collective image of a global black aristocracy. In an imposingly scaled painting — just over seven feet tall — the artist presents Mr. Obama dressed in the regulation black suit and an open-necked white shirt  and seated on a vaguely thronelike chair not so different from the one seen in Stuart’s Washington portrait. But art historical references stop there. So do tonal echoes of past portraits. Whereas Mr. Obama’s predecessors are  to the man  shown expressionless and composed  Mr. Obama sits tensely forward  frowning  elbows on his knees  arms crossed  as if listening hard. No smiles  no Mr. Nice Guy. He’s still troubleshooting  still in the game. His engaged and assertive demeanor contradicts — and cosmetically corrects — the impression he often made in office of being philosophically detached from what was going on around him. At some level  all portraits are propaganda  political or personal. And what makes this one distinctive is the personal part. Mr. Wiley has set Mr. Obama against — really embedded him in — a bower of what looks like ground cover. From the greenery sprout flowers that have symbolic meaning for the sitter. African blue lilies represent Kenya  his father’s birthplace  jasmine stands for Hawaii  where Mr. Obama himself was born  chrysanthemums  the official flower of Chicago  reference the city where his political career began  and where he met his wife. Mrs. Obama’s choice of Ms. Sherald as an artist was an enterprising one. Ms. Sherald  who was born in Columbus  Ga.  in 1973 and lives in Baltimore  is just beginning to move into the national spotlight after putting her career on hold for some years to deal with a family health crisis  and one of her own. (She had a heart transplant at 39.) Production-wise  she and Mr. Wiley operate quite differently. He runs the equivalent of a multinational art factory  with assistants churning out work. Ms. Sherald  who until a few years ago made her living waiting tables  oversees a studio staff of one  herself. At the same time  they have much in common. Both focused early on African-American portraiture precisely because it is so little represented in Western art history. And both tend to blend fact and fiction. Mr. Wiley  with photo-realistic precision  casts actual people in fantastically heroic roles. (He modifies his heroizing in the case of Mr. Obama  but it’s still there.) Ms. Sherald also starts with realism  but softens and abstracts it. She gives all her figures gray-toned skin — a color with ambiguous racial associations — and reduces bodies to geometric forms silhouetted against single-color fields. She shows Mrs. Obama sitting against a field of light blue  wearing a spreading gown. The dress design  by Michelle Smith  is eye-teasingly complicated: mostly white interrupted by black Op Art-ish blips and patches of striped color suggestive of African textiles. The shape of the dress  rising pyramidally upward  mountain-like  feels as if it were the real subject of the portrait. Mrs. Obama’s face forms the composition’s peak  but could be almost anyone’s face  like a model’s face in a fashion spread. To be honest  I was anticipating — hoping for — a bolder  more incisive image of the strong-voiced person I imagine this former first lady to be. And while I’m wishing  let me mention something more. Mr. Obama’s portrait will be installed  long-term  among those of his presidential peers  in a dedicated space on the second floor. Mrs. Obama’s will hang in a corridor reserved for temporary displays of new acquisitions — on the first floor. It will stay there until November  after which there’s no set-aside place for it to land. If first men have an acknowledged showcase  first women — ladies or not — should too. Better  they should all be together  sharing space  offering a welcoming environment to  among others  a future first female president  and creating a lasting monument to #MeToo.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/us/politics/obama-mandela-south-africa-speech.html,Setting Tone for Post-Presidency  Obama Will Speak in South Africa on Tolerance Advertisement Supported by None None To those who have paid only casual attention to former President Barack Obama’s foreign travels since he left the White House in January 2017  it can seem as if Mr. Obama has been on an extended vacation of the kind only the very rich can afford. But the former president has also met quietly with groups of young people in New Zealand  Brazil  Indonesia and Singapore  as well as paying calls on foreign leaders  including Xi Jinping of China  Emmanuel Macron of France  Justin Trudeau of Canada and Malcolm Turnbull of Australia. Now  Mr. Obama is inaugurating his most significant international project as an ex-president  with an announcement on Monday that the Obama Foundation plans to convene 200 young people this July in Johannesburg for five days of meetings  workshops and technical training. At the same time  Mr. Obama will deliver a lecture to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Nelson Mandela  whom he eulogized after his death five years ago by saying he “makes me want to be a better man.” None “It gives him an opportunity to lift up a message of tolerance  inclusivity and democracy at a time when there are obviously challenges to Mandela’s legacy around the world ” said Benjamin J. Rhodes  a former speechwriter for Mr. Obama who still advises him. “Mandela ” he added  “endured far darker times than anything we’re enduring today.” Mr. Obama does not plan to take on Mr. Trump directly  in keeping with his practice of not publicly criticizing his successor. But Mr. Rhodes said he would not shrink from confronting the divisive issues raised by the Trump presidency. “There’s an enhanced sense of tribalism in the world ” he said. “Our unifying theory is that the best way to promote inclusive and democratic societies is by empowering young people in civil society.” Mr. Obama  he said  views this as the most important speech he has given since leaving the White House  one that will set the tone for his post-presidency. Mandela was a beacon to Mr. Obama  inspiring what he once said was his first “act of political activism” — a speech he gave as a student at Occidental College for the anti-apartheid movement. None Mr. Obama and his wife  Michelle  remained in Washington after he left office  so their younger daughter  Sasha  could finish school. But they have kept a low profile in the capital. Much of Mr. Obama’s time is spent working on his presidential memoir. He has largely steered clear of domestic politics  though aides said they expected him to return to the campaign trail as the midterm elections draw closer. Overseas  however  Mr. Obama has cut a wider swath. He has visited 16 countries for speeches or meetings  drawing crowds and V.I.P. treatment everywhere he goes. In Beijing  Mr. Xi invited him to a private dinner to sound him out about political developments in the United States. The Obama Foundation’s emphasis on developing young people  Mr. Rhodes said  is consciously different than the focus of other foundations  like those of Bill Clinton or Bill and Melinda Gates  which tend to concentrate on solving specific problems. He said it drew on Mr. Obama’s roots as a community organizer in Chicago. “When I was in my last year in office  part of what I asked myself is  ‘What would be the most important contribution I could make?’” Mr. Obama said during a recent round table with young people in Singapore. “What I really felt most strongly about was  ‘How do we develop the next generation of leaders?’” The Obama Foundation’s Africa program is a yearlong initiative that aims to train people for roles in government  civil society and the private sector. The 200 participants were chosen from an applicant pool of nearly 10 000  said Bernadette Meehan  a former diplomat who oversees the program as chief international officer of the foundation. Mr. Obama plans to recruit veterans of his administration and big-name friends to speak to the young people in Johannesburg. He will hold a town-hall-style meeting with them at the end  something he made a practice of doing during his trips as president. None A young Vietnamese man asked him about the failure of Congress to ratify the pact  and whether the prospects for the agreement would be better or worse under a new president. “I believe it will be ratified because it’s the right thing to do ” Mr. Obama replied. “We’re in a political season now  and it’s always difficult to get things done. Congress isn’t doing much right now  they’re all going home and talking to constituents  trying to get re-elected. After the election  people can refocus attention on why this is so important.” As it turned out  of course  Mr. Trump was elected  and he pulled the United States out of the trade agreement in his first week in office.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/us/obama-trump-swing-voters.html,They Voted for Obama  Then Went for Trump. Can Democrats Win Them Back? Advertisement Supported by None RITTMAN  Ohio — In the daily race that is her life  Sharla Baker does not think about politics very much. She rises early  drives to the gas station to buy coffee  feeds her baby  dresses her two other children  ages 3 and 2  and hustles them all off to day care. By 9:30 a.m. she pulls into a hair salon 45 minutes away  where she is training to be a cosmetologist. She waxes and cuts all day long  making only the money she earns in tips  which on a recent day last month was $8.41. But Ms. Baker does vote. She picked Barack Obama for president in 2008 and 2012. He seemed sincere and looked like a happy family man. But most important  he was a Democrat. Her great-grandmother  who grew up poor in Pennsylvania  always said that Democrats look out for the poor people. In 2016  though  she voted for Donald J. Trump. Yes  he was rich and seemed mean on his TV show  “The Apprentice.” But she liked how he talked about jobs and wages and people being left out of the economy. Now  more than a year later  she is wavering. “I voted for Trump because I wanted some change going on ” said Ms. Baker  28. “But then again  maybe he’s going to do the wrong change.” The swing of Obama voters to Mr. Trump proved a decisive factor in the 2016 presidential election. Of the more than 650 counties that chose Mr. Obama twice  about a third flipped to Mr. Trump. Many were in states critical to Mr. Trump’s win  like Iowa  Michigan  Ohio and Wisconsin. John Sides  a political-science professor at George Washington University  has estimated that 9 percent of voters who cast ballots for Mr. Obama ended up voting for Mr. Trump. Among white voters who had never been to college  it was 22 percent. Now  as the country lurches into another election season — this time the prize is control of Congress — a crucial question for Democrats is whether they will be able to lure these voters back. The party has had some early successes. Wins in Alabama  Pennsylvania and Virginia have given Democrats hope that voters might be souring on Mr. Trump — to the point that the party might flip control of the House and possibly even the Senate. Next week’s primary races in Ohio and West Virginia  both states that went for Mr. Trump in 2016  will also serve as tests of voter enthusiasm for Democrats. We recently asked people who cast ballots for both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump to describe how they felt about the president and the Democratic Party ahead of the midterms. In interviews with 38 voters in 14 states across four months  a clear pattern emerged. Voters said they did not like Mr. Trump as a person and did not consider themselves die-hard supporters. Some were even embarrassed by him. But many were basically satisfied with his policies. The tax bill was mildly positive  they said. Several had a bit of extra money in their paycheck. They liked that he was trying to address illegal immigration. Only a few regretted their vote. Voters said they still liked Mr. Obama and that they voted for Mr. Trump because they didn’t want to cast a ballot for Hillary Clinton. But they were still open to voting for Democrats — if the party could come up with the right candidates. For the most part  the midterm elections were not yet on their radars. “Honestly  it hasn’t crossed my mind really at all ” Ms. Baker said  when asked about them. Several voters said they chose Mr. Trump for the same reason they chose Mr. Obama: a deep craving for change and disgust with both political parties. Charlotte Griffin  the mayor of Bear Grass  N.C.  a town of about 80 people in the eastern part of the state  said her vote for Mr. Trump was more an act of desperation than a positive political choice. She had grown furious with the national political class — and what she saw as its wealth  ignorance of ordinary people’s lives and inability to get anything done. It was the first time she’d chosen a Republican in 50 years of voting. Her county flipped to Mr. Trump after choosing Mr. Obama twice. “Did I really like Trump? No. I still don’t ” Ms. Griffin said in January. “But at least I thought we might move. We were in a stalemate. We were at dead center zero. We were just sitting there spinning our wheels.” In January  Mr. Trump was defending himself after an uproar over vulgar comments he was said to have made at a closed-door immigration meeting. When asked again in April how she felt  Ms. Griffin said Mr. Trump was still “severely testing my sensibilities.” She said she planned to vote for the same Democrat  G.K. Butterfield  who has been her congressional representative since 2004. “It’s a variable wind situation ” she said by phone  referring to the country. “One day it seems to be going this way  and then all of a sudden it’s going the other way.” Counties like Ms. Griffin’s that flipped from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump have lost ground to the rest of the nation  even more so than the counties that have been solidly Republican. Forty years ago  workers in the flip counties earned 85 cents for every dollar earned by workers in the Democratic strongholds. By 2016  the ratio had fallen to 77 cents. Ms. Baker works at a hair salon Stark County  Ohio  which flipped to Mr. Trump after choosing Mr. Obama twice  and she said the president was an economic disappointment. “He’s not there for the poor and the middle class ” she said  sitting on her mother’s couch in the small town of Rittman. “I thought he would be  but he’s not.” Ms. Baker has worked many jobs since graduating from high school in 2007 — at a Bob Evans restaurant  an Aldi supermarket  a Subway sandwich shop  a packaging plant for camera memory chips and a frame store. All paid badly. She didn’t have health care or 401(k) retirement benefits with any of them. Ms. Baker hated making minimum wage  and how powerless it made her feel  so she enrolled in beauty school to get more control over her life. She had hoped Mr. Trump would raise wages and force companies to give all their employees benefits. But that hasn’t happened. All she hears now is harsh talk by Republicans on TV about poor people: How people who get food stamps are lazy. How they should be given boxes of food instead of money. Ms. Baker knows there is another election this year  but like most people interviewed for this article  she said she had not looked up the candidates yet. She was not sure if she would vote. Many people interviewed went out of their way to say they did not consider themselves Trump supporters. Donna Burgraff  a registered independent in Chillicothe  in southern Ohio  said she finds Mr. Trump boorish. She said that he judges women on their looks and seems to thrive on embarrassing people  behavior that Ms. Burgraff  an associate professor of education at Ohio University  disapproves of. Ms. Burgraff did not like how Mr. Trump kept falsely asserting that Mr. Obama was not born in the United States. “How could that have been anything but racism?” she said. Still  on Election Day 2016  Ms. Burgraff voted for Mr. Trump  if reluctantly. She believed he was the better choice. And looking back she does not regret it. The tax bill has given her an extra $400 a month in her paycheck. “I pulled the lever for Trump  and I’m not sorry I did ” she said over lunch in Chillicothe in March. She said she planned to vote this fall for her Republican congressman  Brad Wenstrup. But others regretted voting for Mr. Trump and are less certain how they will vote this fall. Brad Zeigler  68  a retired police chief in Warren County  Ill.  said he has not liked anything Mr. Trump has done. “I thought maybe he’ll listen to his advisers and they’ll contain him ” said Mr. Zeigler  who  like his county  voted for Mr. Obama twice before choosing Mr. Trump. “But that hasn’t happened.” He said he is furious at himself for having voted for Mr. Trump and is open to voting for Democrats this fall  even though the party no longer really speaks to him. “I’m concerned about our environment ” he said. “I’m concerned about people’s rights. I sound like a far-left person and I’m not!” Instead  Mr. Zeigler said he feels politically homeless. “The Republicans are about money and big business and the Democrats have lost their way. They are not taking care of that core group they know is out there.” Sona Patel contributed research. None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/12/opinion/michelle-obama-portrait-sherald-parker.html,Looking Up to Michelle Obama Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None It was a typical dreary February day when I bundled up my daughters to head to the National Portrait Gallery to see the paintings of Barack and Michelle Obama. If I’d realized it would also be the day that my 2-year-old  Parker  would go viral  I would have taken off the red and pink coat she was wearing and let the outfit she had underneath show. I would have put her favorite headband on her head and insisted that she pose facing the camera. Parker is a precocious  curious  happy child who loves ballet  the movies “Leap” and “Moana ” French fries  spaghetti  her Aunt Jana and Mrs. Obama. She knows Mrs. Obama because she saw her dancing with Ellen DeGeneres on her TV show. We are lucky to live in Washington where most museums are free. As a family  we go often. And although Parker has been to the National Portrait Gallery and I have taken her to numerous other galleries and museums in the city  I have never seen her as captivated as she was when she was looking at Amy Sherald’s portrait of our former first lady. I called her name repeatedly trying to get her to turn around so I could take a photo of her looking at the camera  with the large painting as a backdrop  but she was motionless  completely absorbed in the grandeur of the image. None None None None None The messages drove home one fact: Representation matters. It’s important to me that I raise daughters who have the opportunity to see women who look like them doing great things. Only by being exposed to brilliant  intelligent  kind black women can my girls and other girls of color really understand that their goals and dreams are within reach. As the photo of Parker gained popularity  I was reminded of what Mrs. Obama said at the unveiling of her portrait in February. “I’m also thinking about all the young people — particularly girls and girls of color — who in years ahead will come to this place and they will look up and they will see an image of someone who looks like them hanging on the wall of this great American institution ” she said. In an interview with BuzzFeed  Parker said she thought Mrs. Obama was “a queen ” so when she got the chance to meet the former first lady last week  she was completely awe-struck. Mrs. Obama was kind and gracious  she kicked her shoes off and danced with Parker to Parker’s favorite song  Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off.” They talked  hugged and Parker got to play dress-up in Mrs. Obama’s shoes  a truly surreal moment. I have cried tears of joy in recent days as this has all happened particularly when thinking about Parker’s grandparents  who grew up in a segregated America and never imagined that they would see a black president and first lady or that their granddaughter would one day dance with the former first lady. The photo of Parker embodies Mrs. Obama’s words. It shows a little girl looking up and seeing a dynamic woman who  coincidentally  is brown just like her. Maybe color  gender and race will be insignificant when Parker is an adult — we’ll just all be individuals. This dream lives on and seems closer to realization in every generation. Regardless of whether you marvel at or dislike the Obamas  it’s hard to deny that they changed the fabric of American history  and thanks to them  children like my daughter can dream bigger than they ever imagined.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/opinion/trump-north-korea-nobel-iran-nuclear-deal.html,To Win a Nobel  Trump Should Look to the Iran Deal Advertisement Supported by None Mr. Blinken was a deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration. “President Trump should win the Nobel Peace Prize.” It is hard to imagine anyone other than Mr. Trump expressing that sentiment. But the quote is from his South Korean counterpart  Moon Jae-in  citing Mr. Trump’s work to engineer talks between the two Koreas and the tantalizing prospect of a long-sought peace and denuclearization on the peninsula. None None So  should Mr. Trump start taking seriously talk about a trip to Oslo? The long litany of aborted efforts in the past  the sheer complexity of any negotiations and the many traps along the way suggest not yet. None The Kim family long ago perfected the art of the steal: string out talks  wring out economic concessions and walk away from any commitments. Then  when Washington tightens the noose again  ratchet up tensions and repeat. It’s exactly this dynamic President Obama refused to engage. Even if this time is the exception that breaks the rule and Mr. Kim is serious about denuclearization  the road ahead is long  winding and all uphill. Mr. Kim enters any talks with Mr. Trump from a position of strength. His charm offensive — ardently embraced by Mr. Moon — is quickly corroding Mr. Trump’s leverage. It takes the credible threat of a pre-emptive strike out of America’s arsenal  the world would not understand Mr. Trump resorting to force when Mr. Kim is talking peace. It is likely to weaken sanctions enforcement  with China and even South Korea looking to ease up on their neighbor. It buys time for Mr. Kim to keep tinkering with his bombs and missiles  albeit without the testing necessary to perfect them. The very fact of meeting with an American president conveys legitimacy to Mr. Kim that his father and grandfather sought but never secured. Mr. Kim also scored a coup by getting Mr. Moon to put peace talks on a separate and faster track than denuclearization. Previous American administrations held out the former as a reward for the latter. Mr. Trump will have to decide whether to countenance this reversal or risk a split with South Korea. In the best-case scenario  we are only at the very beginning of a monumentally complex process that will require meticulous technical planning and sustained diplomacy — not exactly hallmarks of the Trump administration to date. It took almost two years to negotiate the final nuclear accord with Iran  which  unlike North Korea  did not possess nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump is on the verge of scrapping the Iran deal. That would be a monumental mistake in its own right  giving Iranian hard-liners the excuse to speed toward a breakout nuclear capacity  but without a united international coalition to oppose them or inspectors to expose them. It would also make getting to yes with Pyongyang even more challenging. Iran is complying with the agreement. If Mr. Trump tears it up anyway  why would Mr. Kim trust anything Mr. Trump says or signs? And by scrapping the accord  Mr. Trump would set the bar almost impossibly high on any deal with North Korea  whose terms will have to be demonstrably better. Can Mr. Trump get Pyongyang to verifiably dismantle the vast bulk of its nuclear enterprise up front or accept the most intrusive inspections regime ever  as Mr. Obama did with Iran? Instead of shredding the Iran accord  Mr. Trump should apply its basic template to North Korea. First  negotiate an interim deal that freezes Pyongyang’s program in place and starts to roll it back  gets inspectors on the ground and offers modest  carefully measured economic relief. Then use the resulting time to produce a more comprehensive agreement  ideally to include denuclearization and a peace treaty. By some combination of accident and design  Mr. Trump has helped create a moment of opportunity in a place of enduring peril. If he keeps his eyes on the prize  he may not make it to Oslo  but he could make the world a less dangerous place. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/obama-trump-voters-democrats.html,The Missing Obama Millions Advertisement Supported by Opinion None Much of the political commentary since the presidential election has focused on two groups of party switchers: those who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Donald Trump in 2016 and those who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. None Frustratingly  however  these perspectives play down the importance of a crucial group of disaffected voters: those who voted for Mr. Obama in 2012 but then failed to go to the polls in 2016. Because this group is disproportionately young and black  this erasure is racially tinged. Our analysis shows that while 9 percent of Obama 2012 voters went for Mr. Trump in 2016  7 percent — that’s more than four million missing voters — stayed home. Three percent voted for a third-party candidate. We would hardly urge Democratic strategists to abandon Obama-to-Trump voters. However  Obama-to-nonvoters are a relatively liberal segment of the country who have largely been ignored. They are mostly young and nonwhite  and they represent an important part of the Democratic Party’s demographic future. Given the likelihood that many Obama-to-Trump voters will remain in Republican ranks  it is hard to imagine how Democrats can win elections if this group remains on the sidelines. None So who were the Obama-to-nonvoters? Fifty-one percent were people of color  compared with 16 percent of Obama-to-Trump voters and 34 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters. Twenty-three percent of Obama-to-nonvoters were under 30  compared with 11 percent of Obama-to-Trump voters and 10 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters. More than 60 percent of Obama-to-nonvoters make less than $50 000 a year  compared with 45 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters and 52 percent of Obama-to-Trump voters. Before the 2016 election  these voters were often identified as part of the “rising American electorate” by Democratic strategists who hoped that demographic shifts would be a boon to the party. But these shifts are meaningless if Democrats can’t get enough young people of color to the polls. What do Obama-to-nonvoters prefer  policy-wise? Are they more similar to Obama-to-Clinton voters or to Obama-to-Trump voters? The answers to these questions have important implications for the future of Democratic Party politics  so we analyzed the preferences of all three groups of voters across a broad range of domestic policy areas  including support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  abortion rights  E.P.A. regulation of carbon emissions  cuts in domestic spending  an increase in the minimum wage  and an end to mandatory minimums in criminal sentencing  as well as opposition to the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Two clear patterns emerged. First  it will come as no surprise that Obama-to-Trump voters adopt the most conservative positions. In fact  Obama-to-Trump voters express the most conservative views of any Obama voters in each of the seven areas examined in this analysis. Second  the preferences of Obama-to-nonvoters are almost always closer to the preferences of Obama-to-Clinton voters than they are to Obama-to-Trump voters. For example  nearly three-quarters of Obama-to-Trump voters supported repeal of the A.C.A.  while less than half of Obama-to-nonvoters did. The extremely high degree of support for repeal of the A.C.A. among Obama-to-Trump voters clearly played a role in the 2016 election and in the negative reaction to Mr. Obama among this group of voters more broadly. However  considering how strongly Obama-to-Clinton voters in particular favor the A.C.A.  it is hard to imagine how Democrats could incorporate anti-A.C.A. voters into future Democratic coalitions. Obama-to-nonvoters are most similar to Obama-to-Clinton voters on the minimum wage  though the proposal draws strong majority support from Obama-to-Trump voters as well. Obama-to-Trump voters are most out of line with the Democratic coalition on issues relating to race and gender. They are less supportive of a path to citizenship  and a supermajority (64 percent) of Obama-to-Trump voters support deporting undocumented immigrants. At 72 percent  Obama-to-nonvoters are also far more in favor of abortion rights than Obama-to-Trump voters are (55 percent). Over all  Obama-to-nonvoters are quite close to the emerging Democratic consensus on issues of class  race  gender and the environment. Democratic strategists should recognize that Obama-to-Trump voters do not represent the future of their party. Obama-to-Trump voters diverge from the Democratic Party on many core issues  and in any case they are not particularly loyal Democrats: Less than one third of Obama-to-Trump voters supported Democrats down-ballot in 2016  and only 37 percent identify as Democrats. In stark contrast  Obama-to-nonvoters share the progressive policy priorities of Democrats  and they strongly identify with the Democratic Party. Four out of every five Obama-to-nonvoters identify as Democrats  and 83 percent reported they would have voted for a Democrat down-ballot. A similar share of Obama-to-nonvoters said that they would have voted for Mrs. Clinton had they turned out to vote. In short  while reclaiming some Obama-to-Trump voters would be a big help to Democratic prospects  re-energizing 2012 Obama voters who stayed home is a more plausible path for the party going forward. Whether Democrats can mobilize these voters is an open question  however. Significantly  only 43 percent of Obama-to-nonvoters reported being contacted by a candidate in 2016  compared with 66 percent of Obama-to-Clinton voters. While analysts have focused on why many conservative voters switched to the Republican Party  a better question might be why a campaign that sought to energize young voters of color failed to do so. That’s the question that will decide the future of American politics. Getting these voters to the polls on Election Day is the most important task for progressives. And given their outlook on the important issues of the day  Obama-to-nonvoters are also likely to be easier to mobilize after two years of a Trump presidency — never mind four.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/books/review/peter-baker-obama-the-call-of-history.html,Remembering President Obama Advertisement Supported by None None I cannot look at Peter Baker’s extra-large and lavishly illustrated history of the Obama years without thinking of my mother. She supported Hillary Clinton in 2008  but after the convention she put two Barack Obama stickers on the bumper of her red Prius and they were still there the day she died  in December 2012  six weeks after she voted for him again. She was passionate about politics  and intensely partisan  and if cancer had not killed her  Trump’s candidacy might well have — long before election night. But if she were here  she would buy a dozen copies of “Obama: The Call of History ” lay them out on her coffee table and all over her house  and then not have the heart to crack the cover. None None Baker  The Times’s chief White House correspondent through Obama’s tenure  is neither fanboy nor debunker. A few sentences from his epilogue are characteristic of his determination to be fair: Obama “enjoyed two years of sweeping legislative victories arguably not seen since the days of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society  then spent six years fighting for inches against an opposition-dominated Congress that he barely bothered to woo and that did not want to work with him in the first place.” “He took great strides toward his goals in health care  financial regulation and climate change  only to fall short in immigration  criminal justice and income inequality.” “Obama put two women on the Supreme Court and helped break down barriers for gay and lesbian Americans  even as racial minorities remained far behind in education and income.” Line by line  issue after issue  Baker balances opportunities and obstacles  promises and results  criticism and praise. Obama himself takes the long view  likening the course of events to “a long-running story.” Actually  it is the “one damn thing after another” out of which historians construct long-running stories. Baker’s is an early draft. What historians writing decades from now make of Obama will have as much to do with what happens between now and then as it does with what happened during his presidency. The first thing that happened to Obama’s political legacy was the election of Donald J. Trump  who promised to undo his signature achievements. Time will tell. Obama’s reputation is another matter. Trump has already been good for that. Obama’s favorability rating has risen steadily since January. And very likely not since tributes to the assassinated John F. Kennedy will a book of photographs of a president so recently departed make millions of Americans want to cry.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/nyregion/assembly-bohen-democrat-republican.html,Elected on G.O.P. Line  a Democrat Sits Alone Advertisement Supported by None ALBANY — Erik T. Bohen does not have cooties. He dresses well  sits up straight and comports himself like any other member of the State Assembly  the body to which he was elected late last month in a special election in Buffalo. None After arriving in the Assembly on Monday  Mr. Bohen discovered that his desk and chair were situated in a no man’s land  isolated from the Democrats  who dominate the chamber and occupy the entirety of its left-hand side  as well as being separated from his Republican neighbor by a narrow gap. Mr. Bohen  35  said he was a wee bit perplexed. “I said  ‘This is a little strange  this desk.’ There’s nothing on the left  there’s nothing on the right. There’s just this trash can.” A message  it seemed  had been delivered  one that Carl E. Heastie  the Assembly speaker  who is in charge of seating assignments  later elaborated on. “It’s a challenge when people don’t get elected on the Democratic line but then want to sit with the conference ” Mr. Heastie said on Wednesday  noting that when Mr. Bohen won his April 24 special election  a local Republican Party chairman appeared on stage with him. “I think the message that we want to send is that you should run as a Democrat and sit as a Democrat.” “He tells me he’s a true Democrat ” he added. “But he’ll have to prove that.” Such statements are not made in a vacuum in the Capitol. In the State Senate  the Republicans control the chamber by a single vote: That’s the one possessed by a Democrat  Simcha Felder  who nonetheless sits and caucuses with Republicans  giving them a crucial 32nd vote in a 63-seat chamber. (Mr. Felder  who says he is loyal to no party  also ran as a Republican  unopposed  in his last re-election campaign  in 2016.) Mr. Heastie said his situation in the Assembly is entirely different  as Democrats hold an overwhelming numeric advantage  regardless of where Mr. Bohen sits or which party he votes with. But he also suggested that there were certain concerns among Democratic Assembly members about espionage inside their members-only meetings  in which he said “sensitive” issues were often discussed. “So there’s also a trust concern ” Mr. Heastie said. None Mr. Bohen  who was a special-education teacher in a Buffalo elementary school before coming to Albany  concedes that he was backed by Republicans but said he ran with them only because the local Democratic Party rejected him in favor of another candidate in the 142nd District. “I’m a very independent person ” he said while maintaining that he supports Mr. Heastie and wants to sit with the Democrats  even if the feeling isn’t mutual at the moment. “I’m still a man without a home.” Mr. Bohen said that despite the seating situation  “everyone’s been extremely kind ” and that he had a nice office. “They’re not throwing me in the basement ” he said. Like anyone who has ever sat alone in a high school cafeteria  Mr. Bohen also seems to recognize there are certain perks to being an outcast  saying it’s “almost like I’m a celebrity.” And he’s already planned to decorate with desert-island desk ornaments. “Next week ” he said  “I’m going to bring a little palm tree.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/opinion/conor-lamb-how-a-democrat-succeeds-in-trump-country.html,How a Democrat Succeeds in Trump Country Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None When the Democratic candidate Conor Lamb began his race in a special election in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district  he faced headwinds of the type that caused horizontal snow in the nor’easter last week. For starters  Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points in 2016. The district has been held by Republicans for most of the last 50 years. Conservative “super PACS” were willing to spend millions — it ended up being around $10 million — to buy TV time to savage Mr. Lamb. The incumbent  Tim Murphy  a conservative anti-abortion Republican  had a lock on re-election until The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported last year that he had urged his mistress to have an abortion. Republican House leaders decided that Mr. Murphy had to go. He resigned in October. The man Republicans chose as their candidate was Rick Saccone  a Jurassic-era conservative who boasted that he was “Trump before Trump was Trump.” That apparently was a few Trumps too many for voters in the 18th  which begins in the Pittsburgh suburbs and slithers its way  in classic gerrymandering fashion  through conservative small towns and rural areas toward the West Virginia border. It’s no wonder that Mr. Saccone entered the race as the favorite. This race was Mr. Saccone’s to lose — and darned if he didn’t. None The problem with political campaigns is that they don’t exist in theory but in fact. Factors like the candidate’s personality can carry weight  as does the effectiveness of his field effort and advertising. And  lest we forget  his position on the issues. Mr. Saccone  60  was a wet blanket of a candidate  without a scintilla of charisma. He also didn’t particularly care for campaigning  organized few public rallies and rarely took to the streets to speak with voters. He let the super PACS do the talking for him  with saturation TV ads. While Mr. Saccone was a mediocre campaigner  Mr. Lamb was an excellent one. He has a sterling all-American résumé: Marine  federal prosecutor  scion of a politically prominent Democratic family from Mount Lebanon. At 33  he had the stamina and the desire to knock on door after door. He stopped wearing a suit and tie on block visits after one resident yelled “You’re a Jehovah’s Witness!” at him. Mr. Lamb yelled right back  “I’m a Catholic!” The race in the 18th morphed into a side-door referendum on Mr. Trump  and on Tuesday turnout was high in both red and blue portions of the district. Mr. Lamb’s strongest showing was in Allegheny County  where suburban voters — including Republicans — provided him with votes. Mr. Saccone ran up his votes in the three outlying counties. Ted Kopas  a Democrat who is a Westmoreland County commissioner  warned about finding national or even cosmic trends in analyzing Mr. Lamb’s victory. “Before you get try to put too much theory into voters’ minds  I think all the credit should go to Conor Lamb ” Mr. Kopas said. “There is no substitute for a candidate who is willing to go everywhere and do anything. He is the kind of person who  when people meet him  they like him. Smart and articulate. He is the picture of what people want to see in a congressman.” Voters also liked his politics. Last weekend  Cecil Roberts  president of the United Mine Workers  reached deep into his bag of compound adjectives to declare at a Lamb rally: “He’s a God-fearing  union-supporting  gun-owning  job-protecting  pension-defending Democrat.” The 18th has long been the anger zone of state politics  populated by contrarians known mostly for their dislikes: of social progressives  of abortion  of politicians from the east (read: Philadelphia)  of anti-gun do-gooders — the list could go on. With the demise of coal and steel and ancillary industries  we are witnessing the “revenge of the working class ” according to someone who should know. David Levdansky was a state legislator from Allegheny County  a pro-union Democrat who served for 26 years until he was unseated by Mr. Saccone in 2010 by 151 votes. Two years later  in a rematch  Mr. Saccone won again — by 112 votes. The defeat still stings. What the collapse of core industries did was create a cadre of voters who  as Mr. Levdansky said  mimicking these angry voters’ message: “We want change! Give us change! We want to punish the elected officials in office!” To Mr. Levdansky  Mr. Saccone is a “charlatan” who specializes in feeding voters red-meat issues while supporting cuts in education and human services. In the Pennsylvania House  Mr. Saccone introduced one bill to require schools to emblazon “In God We Trust” on every building and another to allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons without a permit. None President Trump stopped by the district for a rally on Saturday night at which he spent five minutes urging the crowd to support Mr. Saccone and 70 minutes talking about himself. If Mr. Saccone prided himself on being a Trump clone  Mr. Lamb bears a striking resemblance to another successful Democratic Pennsylvania: Senator Bob Casey  who is also pro-union and anti-abortion  although Mr. Lamb takes the position that while he is personally opposed to abortion  the laws should not change. Mr. Casey’s brand of politics  and his nice-guy persona  work well in Pennsylvania. When he first ran for the Senate in 2006  Mr. Casey won the 18th by 11 percentage points. It’s all the more impressive because the man he defeated was Rick Santorum (another angry man  come to think of it) who represented the district until he quit to run for the Senate. In another era  Mr. Casey would be called a centrist. Now  he’s too conservative for progressives and too liberal for conservatives. The only people who like him are the voters. Mr. Lamb does not meet the test of ideological purity sought by his party’s progressive wing  but the future of the party may rest upon Democrats like him  who have the insight to understand Mr. Trump’s appeal and act accordingly. Ivory Soap Democrats won’t cut it in territory like the 18th. One additional note: whoever wins should take only a short-term lease on his district offices. After all this storm and fury — not to mention the millions spent — the 18th in its current form is likely to disappear. The state Supreme Court has redrawn all congressional district lines effective in the November election though Republicans have sued in federal court to overturn the redistricting. In any case  if Mr. Lamb’s lead holds  to keep his seat he will have to run again in the fall for a full two-year term. And although the image is still a little blurry  the results of the latest political Rorschach test are in  and it doesn’t look good for Mr. Trump or his party.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/opinion/tennessee-democrat-phil-bredesen.html,Can a Tennessee Democrat Pull a Doug Jones? Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None Mr. Cavendish is the former editor of The Nashville Scene. To understand how Phil Bredesen  a former Democratic governor of Tennessee  has a chance of winning this year’s race to replace Bob Corker as the junior senator from this deep-red state  it helps to know a story making the rounds in Nashville about his likely Republican opponent  Representative Marsha Blackburn. After returning from a 1995 trip to Los Angeles to drum up support for the Tennessee film industry  Ms. Blackburn  the executive director of the state’s Film  Entertainment and Music Commission  submitted her expense receipts to the office of the Republican governor  Don Sundquist. The office sent them back  saying that a limousine was inappropriate for a state official. Ms. Blackburn said she didn’t hire a limo  but paid the charges  she then set the receipts on fire and sent the ashes to her superiors with a note: “Copy of L.A. expense report as requested!” The story would remain a fun bit of political lore  save for one detail: Today those ashes are in the care of a Bredesen staffer. Someone in Mr. Sundquist’s circle saved them  waiting for a chance to pass them along to the right person with a pointed message: There are a lot of Republicans waiting to see Marsha Blackburn fall. None Mr. Bredesen spent two terms as governor  from 2003 to 2011  with a pro-business reputation. But since he last ran for office  in 2006  when he won all 95 counties  his party has suffered a string of defeats: only in Nashville and Memphis do Democrats hold congressional seats  at the state level  Democrats have been reduced to superminority status in both houses  meaning they are not even needed for the Legislature to hold session. Why then did Mr. Bredesen  at 74  dive back into the political fray? Associates say that he never would have challenged Mr. Corker  a friend and  like him  a former mayor and businessman  but the thought of losing a nominal check on Mr. Trump bothered him. And even last fall  before the Democrat Doug Jones beat Roy Moore for a Senate seat in Alabama  internal Democratic polls put him slightly ahead of Ms. Blackburn in a state that Donald Trump carried by 26 percentage points. None But a statewide campaign in Tennessee is not like running in a safe House district or doing another segment on Fox News. And not all Republicans are alike. Take East Tennessee  which has produced many of the statewide Republicans in recent years  including Mr. Corker  Lamar Alexander  Howard Baker and the current governor  Bill Haslam. Mountain Republicans have 150 years of political tradition and  while conservative  have often displayed a pragmatic streak. But in Middle Tennessee  the conservatism is newer  and more cultural. The state’s biggest wingnuts  like the senator whose anti-L.G.B.T. student bill was referred to as “Don’t say gay ” primarily hail from here. Ms. Blackburn’s 7th District  running from Kentucky to Alabama  draws heavily from this area and her stance on many issues has played well with that crowd. But even in Middle Tennessee there are some ominous signs for Republicans. In a special election for a State Senate seat in December  a Democrat lost by just 307 votes  in a district Mr. Trump carried by more than 50 percentage points. While Mr. Trump’s rhetoric may play well nationally  it may be a tougher sell at the state level  where personalities  local politics and the driving need to get something done dominate. Ms. Blackburn is a barnburner  it’s not clear that she can be a barn-builder. On the stump  she’s more comfortable talking up illegal immigration and  at an event in Murfreesboro  calling for the support of a candidate who believes in creationism. In contrast  Mr. Bredesen’s latest spot emphasizes that as senator he would support a good idea  even if it comes from Mr. Trump. His get-it-done message resonates with state Republican leaders  including Mr. Corker  who couldn’t even say Ms. Blackburn’s name in a recent appearance on CNN. “I’ve said I’m gonna plan to vote for this person ” Corker told an incredulous Dana Bash  before adding that Mr. Bredesen “is my friend ” adding  “I’m not gonna campaign against him.” In a race that could determine control of the Senate  Tennessee Republicans may hold their nose and vote for Ms. Blackburn. Then again  one of the wealthiest of them  Colleen Conway-Welch  held a fund-raiser for Mr. Bredesen  which raised $350 000. Ms. Conway-Welch and her husband  Ted Welch  have supported Republicans for decades. But Ms. Blackburn appears to be a bridge too far. If this keeps up  the Sundquist staffer who held onto those ashes for years may finally get revenge.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/28/us/politics/ap-us-veterans-affairs-jackson.html,"Trump Says Democrat Should Quit Over VA Nomination Brouhaha Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — A furious President Donald Trump on Saturday called for the resignation of the Democratic senator who assembled and released what he called ""false"" allegations that scuttled the nomination of the White House doctor who'd been in line to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. Trump stepped up his criticism of Montana's Jon Tester  the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans' Committee  in two tweets days after asserting that Tester ""has to have a big price to pay"" politically in the GOP friendly state for his leading role in Ronny Jackson's failed VA bid. Tester faces a competitive re-election race this year. Tester  in a statement  didn't directly respond to Trump but said he was committed to aiding veterans. At issue are allegations that Tester has said were brought to his attention by more than 20 military and retired military personnel who've worked with Jackson. Tester said not investigating would have been ""a dereliction of duty"" and said making them public was important for the sake of transparency. The charges against Jackson raised questions about his prescribing practices and leadership ability  including accusations of drunkenness on the job. Tester's office collected the allegations  which included a claim that Jackson ""got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle"" at a Secret Service going-away party. Trump tweeted early Saturday that the allegations ""are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign."" Trump said people in Montana  a state he won by 20 percentage points in 2016  ""will not stand for this kind of slander."" He called Jackson ""the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire  and now  for no reason whatsoever  his reputation has been shattered. Not fair  Tester!"" Before leaving for a rally in Michigan  Trump directed another tweet at Tester  likening the senator's claims against Jackson to the ""phony Russian Collusion"" accusations leveled against Trump's 2016 campaign. ""Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!"" In his free-wheeling remarks Saturday night  Trump told his supporters that ""what Tester did to this man is a disgrace."" He also insinuated that Tester himself could be the target of allegations: ""I know things about Tester that I could say  too. And if I said 'em  he'd never be elected again."" He didn't elaborate. A written statement by Tester didn't respond directly to Trump's tweets. ""It's my duty to make sure Montana veterans get what they need and have earned  and I'll never stop fighting for them as their Senator "" it said. It also said Trump has signed eight Tester bills on veterans into law. A spokeswoman for the committee chairman  Sen. Johnny Isakson  R-Ga.  declined comment Saturday on Trump's tweets. When Amanda Maddox was asked whether Isakson was troubled by Tester's release of the allegations  she cited comments the chairman made Thursday: ""Everyone has an obligation if they make a charge to release it. And everyone who is charged has a right to have a day in court to be heard."" The White House said Friday  one day after Jackson withdrew his nomination  that internal records raise doubt about some of the most serious accusations. The White House said its records  including police reports  show Jackson was in three minor incidents in government vehicles during the past five years  but none involved the use of alcohol and he was not found to be at fault. In one case  a side-view mirror was clipped by a passing truck. In another incident an enraged driver in Montgomery County  Maryland  allegedly punched out Jackson's window during a morning drive to Camp David. The White House medical unit that Jackson ran successfully passed regular controlled substance audits  according to the records for the last three years. The reviews did recommend improvements to the medical unit's handling of controlled substances  but did not find misconduct. The Associated Press reviewed the documents Friday. They were the result of an internal White House review of allegations raised against Jackson during his brief confirmation process. The White House says the records disprove the allegations. Tester's office has not specified the time frame during which the alleged misconduct occurred  and a spokeswoman on Friday said the office would not comment until it knew more about the White House records. Separately  the Secret Service said it has no evidence to support an allegation that its personnel intervened to prevent Jackson from disturbing former President Barack Obama during a foreign trip in 2015. In a statement dated Thursday  the Secret Service said it had conducted a ""thorough review"" of internal documents related to Obama's foreign trips in 2015 and interviewed people who were present. The agency said it has found ""no information that would indicate the allegation is accurate"" and no record of any incident involving Jackson. CNN had reported allegations that Jackson drunkenly banged on the hotel room door of a female employee and that Secret Service personnel intervened out of concern that he would wake Obama. Jackson has denied the accusations  calling them ""baseless and anonymous attacks"" on his character and integrity that are ""completely false and fabricated."" The Democratic staff on the Senate committee also claimed Jackson had doled out such a large supply of a prescription opioid that staffers panicked because they thought the drugs were missing. They said their allegations were based on conversations with 23 of Jackson's current and former colleagues at the White House Medical Unit.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/us/politics/trump-tester-jackson-va.html,Trump Calls on Montana Democrat to Resign in Fight Over Failed V.A. Nomination Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — President Trump called on Saturday for the resignation of Senator Jon Tester and threatened to spread allegations about the Democratic lawmaker in retaliation for helping to thwart his effort to install the White House physician in the cabinet. None “Tester started throwing out things that he’s heard ” Mr. Trump said at a rally with boisterous supporters in Washington Township  Mich. “Well  I know things about Tester that I could say  too. And if I said them  he’d never be elected again.” Mr. Trump did not elaborate  but it was not the first time he has darkly insinuated that he knew secrets about a political adversary that he threatened to make public. During the Republican presidential primary contests in 2016  he warned that he might “spill the beans” on the wife of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas  one of his rivals for the party nomination  a comment he never explained or followed up on. The president has for days been sharply criticizing Mr. Tester  a Democrat from Montana  while ignoring Republican resistance to Dr. Jackson’s nomination. Mr. Tester  the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs  took the lead in publicly questioning Dr. Jackson’s record  but he had the support of Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia  the Republican chairman of the committee  who signed a joint statement saying the issues should be investigated. None None The allegations were raised by more than 20 current and former military personnel who had worked with Dr. Jackson  whose White House medical unit is run by the military  Mr. Tester said  and each of the individual assertions was made by two or more people. Several of those military officials also described their experiences and concerns about Dr. Jackson to reporters  although they spoke on the condition of anonymity because of their status as members of the military. Dr. Jackson called the allegations false and had the support not just of Mr. Trump but also of some former aides to President Barack Obama who said they had never observed the alleged behavior while they worked in the White House. But Dr. Jackson pulled his nomination on Thursday  when it became clear he was unlikely to be confirmed. None None Mr. Tester fired back a few hours later with a statement noting that Mr. Trump had signed eight of the senator’s bills to make the Department of Veterans Affairs more accountable and responsive to veterans. “It’s my duty to make sure Montana veterans get what they need and have earned  and I’ll never stop fighting for them as their senator ” he said. None Three cases were found involving Dr. Jackson and a government vehicle  according to the White House: In one  he was rear-ended. In another  a bus sideswiped a mirror on his car. And in a third  a road rage episode  a driver punched through a window on Dr. Jackson’s car. None It was the second time in two days that he had drawn a parallel between Dr. Jackson’s situation and what he said was his own mistreatment at the hands of the Washington establishment. White House aides would not comment on whether the president’s remark about the Secret Service was in reference to anything more than the single episode with a car. Mr. Tester said when he released his list that he had not sought out the allegations against Dr. Jackson  but that military officers had come to the committee with their concerns. He did not pass judgment on their veracity but said that he had a duty to investigate them and wanted to hear Dr. Jackson’s response. A spokeswoman for Mr. Isakson  the Republican committee chairman  said on Saturday that he had no comment on the president’s tweets but pointed to the senator’s comment on Thursday when he said: “I think everyone has an obligation if they make a charge to release it. And everyone who is charged has a right to have a day in court to be heard.” Despite Montana’s conservative tilt  Mr. Tester has appeared to be in good shape to win re-election  and he has expressed no regret and no public concern about the president’s threats. A former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee  Mr. Tester has raised money at a prodigious rate  and had $6.8 million in his campaign account at the end of the last reporting period. He has drawn a relatively undistinguished group of Republican challengers. Among them  Matt Rosendale  the state auditor  seems most likely to emerge as the nominee. None But Mr. Trump’s easy victory in Mr. Tester’s state means his threats cannot be easily dismissed by Democrats. It is likely that Mr. Trump will expend much of his energy in the midterm elections on deep-red states with Democratic senators  including West Virginia  North Dakota and  evidently  Montana. National groups are already spending money in the Montana race  with Americans for Prosperity  the organization funded by the conservative billionaires Charles G. and David H.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/us/texas-ted-cruz-orourke-senate.html,In Texas  Ted Cruz Is Facing an Unusual Challenge: A Formidably Financed Democrat Advertisement Supported by None HOUSTON — Senator Ted Cruz of Texas kicked off his re-election campaign this week with a new Texas-themed slogan and a new video  but something else that was entirely new went largely unspoken — a formidable and well-funded Democratic opponent. None Mr. O’Rourke  a former punk-rock bassist and El Paso city councilman  has raised $13.2 million in the race so far  and outraised Mr. Cruz in three of four Federal Election Commission reporting periods. (Mr. Cruz has not yet reported his latest fund-raising.) In the first three months of 2018  Mr. O’Rourke raised $6.7 million  more than any other Democratic Senate candidate in the country in that period. None “It’s kind of Ann Richards-level enthusiasm  in the crowds he gathers ” said Harold Cook  a Democratic strategist in Austin and former executive director of the Texas Democratic Party  referring to the outspoken Democrat who served as Texas’ governor from 1991 to 1995 before losing to George W. Bush. “I haven’t seen a response like Beto O’Rourke is getting in a very long time. Beto has got that thing  that star-power deal that you can’t predict in advance.” But political analysts say Mr. O’Rourke’s chances are a long-shot at best  despite his fund-raising skills. He remains unknown to many voters  even as he has kept up a hectic travel schedule and visited 228 of the state’s 254 counties. In the Democratic primary last month  Mr. O’Rourke lost a number of counties to two lesser-known Democratic rivals  including the Hispanic-dominated border area of the Rio Grande Valley  parts of East Texas and the northern Panhandle region. On Monday  Mr. Cruz formally began his re-election campaign at a venue that has become one of his favorite political backdrops — the Redneck Country Club in Stafford  17 miles southwest of downtown Houston. His speech and his surroundings were plastered with references to his new campaign slogan: “Tough as Texas.” It is meant to evoke the resilience of the state as it reeled from and united in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. At a campaign event on Tuesday night in San Antonio  Mr. Cruz acknowledged Mr. O’Rourke’s success in fund-raising and the challenge for Republicans this November. “That’s a whole lotta money — there’s no doubt about that — and it has been clear for some time that the hard left is energized and they’re mobilized and they’re angry at the president ” Mr. Cruz said  according to The Texas Tribune. “And we are seeing all across the country  the far left giving millions of dollars to liberal Democrats running for office  and it underscores that Republicans cannot take November for granted.” Mr. Cruz remains popular with Texas conservatives  particularly the Tea Party activists who helped him  back in 2012  clinch the Senate seat by defeating one of the most powerful Republicans in Texas  David Dewhurst  then the lieutenant governor. And Republicans continue to dominate Texas  culturally and politically  controlling both chambers of the Texas Legislature  the governor’s mansion and all of the more than two dozen statewide-elected offices. Democrats have not won any statewide offices since 1994. “Cruz has built-in name identification  conservative credentials and an ‘R’ behind his name  so his candidacy was effectively born on third base ” said Brandon Rottinghaus  a professor of political science at the University of Houston. “These advantages give him a serious head start  but he doesn’t want to be the hare who naps while the tortoise passes him by. O’Rourke’s fund-raising should be an eye opener for Senator Cruz.” Texas Democrats have been in this position before. In 2014  Democrats had believed that Wendy Davis would become the first Democratic governor in decades  but Ms. Davis lost and Greg Abbott won. In 2016  Democrats had believed that Hillary Clinton could win Texas in the presidential race  but she lost and Donald Trump won the state. None “Right now  history and recent elections are still on Ted Cruz’s side  and the dynamics of this state are still on Ted Cruz’s side  for Republicans to win at a statewide election from the governor’s office to senator and on down ” said Ted Delisi  a Republican strategist in Austin who was the national field director for former Gov. Rick Perry’s 2012 presidential campaign. At an event in Waco on Tuesday  Mr. O’Rourke suggested to The Texas Tribune that one of the differences between his race and Ms. Davis’s failed bid for governor in 2014 was the backlash against the Trump White House. “She did not have the benefit of this year  where  I hope you’ll agree  we’ve never seen this level of urgency  this level of motivation ” Mr. O’Rourke said. Asked if he was running against Mr. Cruz or Mr. Trump  Mr. O’Rourke replied  “Neither.” He added: “I’m not running against anybody. That just doesn’t get me going. It doesn’t energize me.” Mr. O’Rourke’s fund-raising success is an outgrowth of a campaign driven by social media  which has refused to accept money from political action committees. Republicans say they are not worried about an upset but are certainly paying attention. They point to the 2002 race for governor  when the Democrat  Tony Sanchez  a Laredo oil executive  spent $67 million and lost to Mr. Perry. They said that Mr. Cruz’s reputation among Texas conservatives took a knock in 2016 after he refused to endorse Mr. Trump at the Republican National Convention  but that Mr. Cruz had largely repaired the damage. “I think he’s recovered from that ” said State Senator Paul Bettencourt  a Houston Republican who is a former treasurer of the Republican Party of Texas and who is supporting Mr. Cruz. “This is an unusual year. The electorate is roiled. Statewide  Republicans are going to have to take these races seriously and campaign accordingly.” On Monday  Mr. Cruz and Mr. O’Rourke jabbed at each other on social media. Mr. O’Rourke’s campaign posted a Snapchat filter of a Cruz event in Beaumont and took a swipe at Mr. Cruz’s failed presidential run. “Ted Cruz visited 99 of Iowa’s 99 counties ” read the filter  which included an image of a frowning Mr. Cruz. “When’s the last time he listened to Texans in Beaumont?” But Mr. Cruz wasn’t taking the bait. He responded on Twitter  saying he had been to the city four times in the past year while pointing out Mr. O’Rourke’s failure to win Jefferson County  which includes Beaumont  in the Democratic primary. “As best I can tell  you’ve been there once for a drive-by campaign event on Feb 9 ” Mr. Cruz wrote on Twitter of Mr. O’Rourke. “Maybe that’s why you lost Jefferson County in the Dem primary.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/opinion/adam-schiff-democrats-impeachment.html,Democrats: Don’t Take the Bait on Impeachment Advertisement Supported by None Representative Adam B. Schiff  a former federal prosecutor  is the ranking member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. None None We had to go back nearly a century to the 1912 trial and conviction of Judge Robert Archibald to find a precedent. After much consideration  we decided to charge him not only for actions while he was on the federal bench  but also for a corrupt scheme he entered into with a bail bond company while a state court judge  and for the false statements he made during his Senate confirmation process. We determined that because Judge Porteous was accused of taking cash and gifts from lawyers whose cases he presided over in state court  there was little question that such actions were incompatible with his responsibility as a federal judge. How could someone in his courtroom be confident of a fair trial  knowing he had solicited and accepted bribes while a judge? In voting overwhelmingly to convict Judge Porteous on every count  the Senate established the precedent that a federal official can be removed for conduct committed before assuming office. Because of the Porteous case  it is clear that if President Trump participated in a conspiracy to defraud the United States during the campaign by colluding with the Russians  there is a historical basis for the Senate to remove him from office. It is even more clear that if he committed the offense of obstruction of justice while in office  that would provide a legal basis for removal. Yet  one of the most important lessons I learned during the Porteous case was that the legal standard for what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor is less important than the practical and political standard that must be met in any impeachment case. And while that political standard cannot be easily or uniformly defined  I think in the present context it means the following: Was the president’s conduct so incompatible with the office he holds that Democratic and Republican members of Congress can make the case to their constituents that they were obligated to remove him? If they cannot  if impeachment is seen by a substantial part of the country as merely an effort to nullify an election by other means  there will be no impeachment  no matter how high the crime or serious the misdemeanor. This is a very high bar  and it should be. Impeachment is an extraordinary remedy  not to be entertained lightly  and in the case of a president  would mean putting the country through a deeply wrenching process. It is instead a remedy that must be considered soberly  mindful of the fact that removing a president from office should be the recourse for only the most serious transgressions. Should the facts warrant impeachment  that case will be made more difficult politically if part of the country feels that removing Mr. Trump is the result that some of their fellow Americans were wishing for all along. During the course of our investigation in the House Intelligence Committee  we have found troubling evidence of both collusion and obstruction of justice. The special counsel  Robert Mueller  has no doubt seen even more than we have  but his investigation is not complete  and our efforts continue as well. There is much more work to do before any of us can say whether the evidence rises to the level that we should consider a remedy beyond the one that voters will render at the ballot box.

A World War II combat veteran who was a large-animal veterinarian and got his start in politics as a small-town alderman  Dr. Melcher was 45 when he went to Washington in 1969. He was one of Montana’s two United States representatives until January 1977  when he succeeded the retiring Mr. Mansfield  the longtime majority leader  and then served two full Senate terms until 1989. None Propelled by a generation of independent Montana voters who favored Democrats and liberal social policies  but tended to be conservative on economic issues  Dr. Melcher supported affirmative action  organized labor  the preservation of public lands and protections for consumers  especially food safety and nutrition programs. He also promoted animal-welfare rights. He strongly defended farm subsidies and was known as a fighter for agriculture  particularly eastern Montana’s wheat growers and cattle ranchers. He introduced bills to promote assistance for elderly Americans  including more access to long-term health care and improvements in cost-of-living formulas used to calculate Social Security benefits for retirees. Dr. Melcher  who was chairman of the Select Committee on Aging  once told the Senate that many poor elderly people did not take advantage of food stamps  Medicaid and other benefits to which they were entitled. “Older Americans really don’t want to become identified with welfare ” he said. “It’s a question of pride and dignity.” None None None None John David Melcher was born in Sioux City  Iowa  on Sept. 6  1924  one of three sons of Anthony Melcher and the former Nell Mentor. His parents were divorced when John was 8  and he and his brother  Robert  stayed with relatives when their father  a traveling salesman of farm pumps  went on the road. Another brother  Patrick  had died earlier. John grew up in Dubuque and Ashton  Iowa  and on a ranch 10 miles outside Oelrichs  S.D. Members of his family recalled that he rode a horse to and from Oelrichs High School  from which he graduated in 1942. On summer vacations  John sometimes accompanied his father on business trips  and on one journey to the West he fell in love with the prairies and mountains of Montana. He attended the University of Minnesota for a year  but left to join the Army in World War II. He served with the 76th Infantry Division in Europe and participated in the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Wounded near Trier  Germany  in 1945  he won the Purple Heart  the Combat Infantryman’s Badge and the Bronze Star. He was discharged and hospitalized at Santa Barbara  Calif. After recuperating in late 1945  he married Ruth Klein  a former high school classmate. They had six children. None Dr. Melcher earned a degree in veterinary medicine from Iowa State University at Ames in 1950. Drawn by memories of a childhood trip with his father  he moved with his family to Forsyth  a community of under 2 000 in eastern Montana. There he established his Yellowstone Veterinary Clinic and treated horses  cattle  pigs and sheep until his election to Congress in 1969. In 1953  he was elected to the Forsyth City Council. Finding a liking and a talent for public service  he won a string of elections  and served as Forsyth’s mayor from 1955 to 1961  as a member of the Montana House of Representatives from Rosebud County from 1961 to 1963  and as a state senator in Helena  the capital  from 1963 to 1967. He then returned to the lower house for two years  but with encouragement from Democratic and legislative colleagues he had his sights set on the national stage. He was a square-jawed  down-to-earth politician whose interests in animals and agriculture grew out of long associations with farmers  ranchers and small-town people in sparsely populated eastern Montana. Dr. Melcher lost his initial race for a seat in Congress in 1966. But in 1969 he won a special election to replace Representative James F. Battin  a Republican who had resigned to take a federal judgeship. Dr. Melcher settled in Missoula after his years in Washington. He founded a lobbying and consulting firm and worked for the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges and for various veterinary medical groups for many years. In an interview for this obituary in 2017  Dr. Melcher recalled his 1984 amendment to the Animal Welfare Act of 1966  requiring that the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates be considered in research. “It was just something I could do ” he said of his measure  which prohibited long periods of isolation in cages and other mental cruelties. Jane Goodall  the primatologist and authority on chimpanzees  hailed his amendment. She visited Dr. Melcher in Washington  gave him a copy of her book “The Chimpanzees of Gombe” (1986) and wrote in an inscription: “When this bill is well and truly implemented  the difference in the lives of hundreds of animals will truly be great.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,politics
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/18/opinion/israel-70th-anniversary.html,Israel’s Self-Inflicted Wounds Advertisement Supported by Op-Ed Contributor None As the state of Israel approaches its 70th anniversary  I am filled with pride as I watch the vulnerable Jewish state of my childhood evolve into the strong and prosperous nation it is today. As president of the World Jewish Congress  I believe that Israel is central to every Jew’s identity  and I feel it is my second home. Yet today I fear for the future of the nation I love. True  the Israeli Army is stronger than any other army in the Middle East. And yes  Israel’s economic prowess is world renowned: In China  India and Silicon Valley  Israel’s technology  innovation and entrepreneurship are venerated. But the Jewish democratic state faces two grave threats that I believe could endanger its very existence. The first threat is the possible demise of the two-state solution. I am conservative and a Republican  and I have supported the Likud party since the 1980s. But the reality is that 13 million people live between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. And almost half of them are Palestinian. If current trends continue  Israel will face a stark choice: Grant Palestinians full rights and cease being a Jewish state or rescind their rights and cease being a democracy. To avoid these unacceptable outcomes  the only path forward is the two-state solution. President Trump and his team are wholly committed to Middle East peace. Arab states such as Egypt  Jordan  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are now closer to Israel than they have ever been  and contrary to news media reports  senior Palestinian leaders are  they have personally told me  ready to begin direct negotiations immediately. But some Israelis and Palestinians are pushing initiatives that threaten to derail this opportunity. Palestinian incitement and intransigence are destructive. But so  too  are annexation plans  pushed by those on the right  and extensive Jewish settlement-building beyond the separation line. Over the last few years  settlements in the West Bank on land that in any deal is likely to become part of a Palestinian state  have continued to grow and expand. Such blinkered Israeli policies are creating an irreversible one-state reality. The second  two-prong threat is Israel’s capitulation to religious extremists and the growing disaffection of the Jewish diaspora. Most Jews outside of Israel are not accepted in the eyes of the Israeli ultra-Orthodox  who control ritual life and holy places in the state. Seven million of the eight million Jews living in America  Europe  South America  Africa and Australia are Modern Orthodox  Conservative  Reform or secular. Many of them have come to feel  particularly over the last few years  that the nation that they have supported politically  financially and spiritually is turning its back on them. By submitting to the pressures exerted by a minority in Israel  the Jewish state is alienating a large segment of the Jewish people. The crisis is especially pronounced among the younger generation  which is predominantly secular. An increasing number of Jewish millennials — particularly in the United States — are distancing themselves from Israel because its policies contradict their values. The results are unsurprising: assimilation  alienation and a severe erosion of the global Jewish community’s affinity for the Jewish homeland. Over the last decade I have visited Jewish communities in over 40 countries. Members in every one of them expressed to me their concern and anxiety about Israel’s future and its relationship to diaspora Jewry. Many non-Orthodox Jews  myself included  feel that the spread of state-enforced religiosity in Israel is turning a modern  liberal nation into a semi-theocratic one. A vast majority of Jews around the world do not accept the exclusion of women in certain religious practices  strict conversion laws or the ban of egalitarian prayer at the Western Wall. They are bewildered by the impression that Israel is abandoning the humanistic vision of Theodor Herzl and taking on a character that does not suit its own core values or the spirit of the 21st century. The leadership of the Jewish world always honors the choices made by the Israeli voter and acts in concert with Israel’s democratically elected government. I’m also keenly aware that Israelis are on the front lines  making sacrifices and risking their own lives every day so that Jews worldwide will survive and thrive. I count myself forever in their debt. But sometimes loyalty requires a friend to speak out and express an inconvenient truth. And the truth is that the specter of a one-state solution and the growing rift between Israel and the diaspora are endangering the future of the country I love so dearly. We are at a crossroads. The choices that Israel makes in the coming years will determine the destiny of our one and only Jewish state — and the continued unity of our cherished people. We must change course. We must push for a two-state solution and find common ground among ourselves so that we can ensure the success of our beloved nation.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/07/us/politics/ap-us-spending-cuts.html,"Trump Proposing Billions in Spending Cuts to Congress Advertisement Supported by None WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is unveiling a multibillion-dollar roster of proposed spending cuts but is leaving this year's $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill alone. The cuts wouldn't have much impact  however  since they come from leftover funding from previous years that wouldn't be spent anyway. The White House said it is sending the so-called rescissions package to lawmakers Tuesday. Administration officials  who required anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter  said the package proposes killing $15 billion in unused funds. A senior official said about $7 billion would come from the Children's Health Insurance Program  or CHIP  which provides health care to kids from low-income families  though that official stressed the cuts won't have a practical impact on the popular program. The administration is trying to use its authority to prod Congress to ""rescind"" spending approved years ago  but even if the package is approved it would only have a tiny impact on the government's budget deficit  which is on track to total more than $800 billion this year. Some of the cuts wouldn't affect the deficit at all since budget scorekeepers don't give credit for rescinded money that they don't think would have ever been spent. For instance  more than $4 billion in cuts to a loan program designed to boost fuel-efficient  advanced-technology vehicles wouldn't result in fewer loans since the loans are no longer being made. And $107 million worth of watershed restoration money from the 2013 Superstorm Sandy aid bill is going unused because local governments aren't stepping up with matching funds. Another $252 million is left over from the 2015 fight against Ebola  which has been declared over. Still  the cuts  if enacted by Congress  would take spending authority off the table so it couldn't be tapped by lawmakers for other uses in the future. The catchall spending bill  for instance  contained $7 billion in cuts to CHIP that were used elsewhere to boost other programs. ""This is money that was never going to be spent "" a senior administration official said on a press call ahead of Tuesday's submission. ""The only thing it would be used for is offsets down the line."" Democrats have supported such cuts in the past  eager to grab easy budget savings to finance new spending. But some Democrats howled over the White House proposal anyway. ""Let's be honest about what this is: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are looking to tear apart the bipartisan Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)  hurting middle-class families and low-income children "" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer  D-N.Y. Pressure from party conservatives to increase cuts in a tentative $11 billion proposal contributed to a delay from Monday's original release date. The White House and tea party lawmakers upset by the budget-busting ""omnibus"" bill have rallied around the plan  aiming to show that Republicans are taking on out-of-control spending. The administration says it will propose cuts to the omnibus measure later in the year. The spending cuts are also a priority for House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy  R-Calif.  who likens them to ""giving the bloated federal budget a much-needed spring cleaning."" But while the package may pass the House it faces a more difficult path — and potential procedural roadblocks — in the Senate. McCarthy wants to succeed soon-to-retire House Speaker Paul Ryan  R-Wis.  and some of his allies view the project as a way to improve his standing with fractious GOP conservatives who blocked his path to the speakership in 2015. The proposal has already had a tortured path even before its unveiling. More pragmatic Republicans  including the senior ranks of the powerful House and Senate Appropriations committees  rebelled against the measure. They argued that it would be breaking a bipartisan budget pact just weeks after it was negotiated. In response  White House budget director Mick Mulvaney cleansed the measure of cuts to the huge omnibus bill. Last month  Mulvaney told lawmakers the plan could have totaled $25 billion or so. Now he says he's planning to submit several different packages of spending cuts — and it's likely they'll get more conservative with each new proposal. Either way  the idea faces a challenging path in Congress — particularly the Senate  where a 51-49 GOP majority leaves little room for error even though budget rules permit rescissions measures to advance free of the threat of Democratic filibusters. But the cuts to the popular children's health insurance program probably could still be filibustered because they are so-called mandatory programs rather than annual appropriations.

This will be the second criminal trial for Sheldon Silver  74  a Democrat who was once among the most politically powerful people in the state. His first  in 2015  ended with a guilty verdict and 12-year prison sentence. That conviction  however  was reversed last July  giving Silver a second chance to avoid possibly spending the rest of his life in prison. The trial is likely to largely be a repeat of the last  tailored slightly to conform to a June 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the definition of a corrupt act. The high-court decision reversing the bribery conviction of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell affected public corruption prosecutions across the country and resulted in the reversal of the convictions of Silver and former New York Senate leader Dean Skelos  a Republican  at separate trials. A retrial of Skelos is scheduled for June. Silver has insisted he is not guilty. A jury was chosen earlier this month to hear the retrial at a federal court in Manhattan. Prosecutors say Silver  who led the Assembly for more than two decades  traded favors  earning $4 million before investing the proceeds to earn another $1 million. He is among more than 30 New York lawmakers who have left office since 2000 after facing criminal or ethnical allegations. More than a dozen of them were convicted of charges including authorizing bribes to get on a ballot  diverting money meant for community programs into a campaign and skimming funds from contributions to a Little League baseball program. Silver  a Manhattan resident  was first elected to the Assembly in 1976. As his power grew  he gained a reputation as a backroom dealer who controlled the fate of nearly every major piece of legislation. He was nicknamed ""the Sphinx."" Silver and Skelos were once among the so-called ""three men in a room"" who control state government. The third man  Gov. Andrew Cuomo  a Democrat  once promised sweeping changes to New York's anti-corruption laws but reforms have been slowed by political fights in the state's legislative bodies. Cuomo hasn't avoided scandal either. In March  a federal jury convicted one of his former top aides  Joseph Percoco  of fraud and accepting bribes. Percoco could get up to 20 years in prison.

The lawyers made their closing arguments in Sheldon Silver's second trial  and jurors deliberated less than an hour over his mail fraud  wire fraud and extortion charges. They were to return Friday. The 74-year-old once-powerful Democrat did not testify in a trial that was surprisingly fast  with 26 witnesses and a slew of exhibits dispensed in less than two weeks — twice as fast as expected. Still  Assistant U.S. Attorney Tatiana Martins said the jury could rely on a ""mountain of evidence in this case"" that Silver earned $5 million illegally to reach the same conclusion as a jury in 2015: Guilty. Defense attorney Michael Feldberg disagreed. The 2015 verdict and the 12-year prison sentence that followed were tossed out last year when the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that a June 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the definition of a corrupt act meant the jury at Silver's first trial was not properly instructed on the law. After the lawyers finished their arguments Thursday  U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni read to jurors the law they must follow in their deliberations. Attorney Michael Feldberg said money Silver received as legal fees for work on behalf of asbestos victims and real estate developers was ""perfectly legal."" He said the fees were ""common  standard and accepted"" and his client disclosed publicly exactly what the law required. Martins said Silver earned $4 million in legal fees and another million dollars by investing the ""dirty money."" She said the extortion charges lodged against Silver resulted from ""a different kind of extortion"" in which Silver used the power of his position to force others to enrich him. Martins said he went to great lengths to cover up his crimes  including putting more than $400 000 in his wife's name so it would not be reported publicly. She said he repeatedly lied to the press and public. ""His corruption  his extortion and his lies would be exposed in this courtroom "" the prosecutor said. Silver was first elected to the Assembly in 1976. He eventually became one of the three most powerful politicians in the state  playing a pivotal role in deciding what legislation made it to a vote.

Silver  74  has pleaded not guilty to charges of honest services fraud  extortion and money laundering. Silver was found guilty of those charges by a jury in November 2015. In May 2016  Caproni sentenced him to 12 years in prison. Last July  however  a New York federal appeals court threw out the conviction. The court ruled that the jury had received improper instructions in light of the Supreme Court's 2016 decision overturning the corruption conviction of former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell. The Supreme Court found in that decision that routine political activities such as arranging meetings or reaching out to public officials were not ""official acts"" that could be prosecuted under federal bribery law. Silver  a Democrat  represented Manhattan's Lower East Side  and was Assembly speaker from 1994 to 2015. Along with Governor Andrew Cuomo and former Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos  he was one of the ""three men in a room"" with effective power to dictate New York legislative priorities. Skelos was convicted of corruption charges in December 2015 and sentenced to five years in prison. His conviction was overturned last year as well  for similar reasons as Silver's  and prosecutors have said they would try him again.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/04/30/us/ap-us-ex-assembly-speaker-trial.html,"Jury Hears Openings at Ex-Assembly Leader's Bribery Trial Advertisement Supported by None NEW YORK — A federal prosecutor accused New York's former assembly speaker Monday of taking millions of dollars in legal fees as bribes  while a defense lawyer insisted there was nothing illegal about the transactions. Sheldon Silver  who for years was one of the most powerful politicians in the state  was ""blinded by greed "" Assistant U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in opening statements at Silver's bribery trial in federal court in Manhattan. ""He abused his power for personal gain."" Defense attorney Michael Feldberg countered by describing the 74-year-old Democrat as a dedicated public servant and argued there was no proof his client pocketed the money in exchange for taking official action. He said accepting payments that far exceeded his income as a lawmaker was ""perfectly  100 percent legal."" The competing portrayals came at Silver's second criminal trial. His first  in 2015  ended with a guilty verdict and 12-year prison sentence — an outcome that was reversed last July by an appeals court that cited a U.S. Supreme Court ruling narrowing public corruption law. Silver  a lawyer first elected to the Assembly in 1976  gained a reputation as a backroom dealer who controlled the fate of nearly every major piece of legislation. But prosecutors allege he also was a politician on the take. Silver persuaded a physician to refer asbestos cancer patients to his law firm so it could seek multimillion-dollar settlements from personal injury lawsuits  a secret arrangement that allowed him to collect about $3 million in referral fees  Williams said. In return  the defendant directed hundreds of thousands of dollars in state grants to a research center run by the doctor  he said. ""Selling your office for $3 million is corruption  pure and simple "" the prosecutor said. The government alleges that Silver made another $1 million in referral fees when he got big real estate developers to take their tax work to another firm. It says he repaid the favor by using his clout in the legislature to win the developers tax breaks and other benefits. But Feldberg told jurors that there was no understanding that the doctor and the developers were paying bribes. He claimed that they didn't even know Silver was collecting the fees. ""The evidence will show there is no quid pro quo  there is no bribe "" he said. Even if it looked like there was a conflict of interest  ""conflict of interest is not a criminal offense "" he added. He also urged the jurors not to allow any distaste for politicians or the fact that Silver got rich while in office influence their views of the case. ""It is just not a crime to be a politician  even a powerful one "" Feldberg said. ""There is nothing illegal about making money  even a lot of money."" The Silver trial is expected to last about a month and is likely to be largely a repeat of the first one  tailored slightly to conform to a June 2016 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the definition of a corrupt act. Among the first witnesses Monday was Dr. Robert Taub  a retired Columbia University doctor who said he agreed to refer asbestos cancer patients to Silver's law firm so it could seek multimillion-dollar settlements from personal injury lawsuits. Taub  82  said he wanted to ""incentivize Mr. Silver to become an advocate for mesothelioma patients."" ___ This story has been corrected to identify the Assistant U.S. Attorney as Damian Williams  not Damien Williams.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/11/world/asia/11reuters-hongkong-politics.html,"Two Ex-Hong Kong Lawmakers Convicted of Unlawful Assembly  Further Sapping Dissent Movement Advertisement Supported by None HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court on Friday found two pro-independence activists guilty of unlawful assembly inside the legislature while they were still lawmakers  dealing a further blow to waning political dissent in the Chinese-ruled territory. Opposition leaders and supporters are fighting multiple court cases and Friday's verdict in Kowloon City Magistrates' Courts is likely to further dent the confidence of activists calling for full democracy  or even outright independence for the former British colony  a red line for Beijing. Baggio Leung  31  and Yau Wai-ching  26  were democratically elected and then dramatically ousted from the Legislative Council for the way in which they took their oaths  criticizing China  in late 2016.  Before they were officially disqualified  the pair tried to barge into a room along with at least eight assistants  scuffling with security officers meanwhile. ""Regardless of whether they were still Legislative Council members on that day  they would not be exempted from criminal liability on account of their capacity as council members "" wrote magistrate Wong Sze-lai in the 65-paged verdict. ""Their acts were likely to cause any person reasonably to fear that the persons so assembled would commit a breach of the peace."" Three assistants were also found guilty of the same charge. Leung and Yau told reporters they would decide whether to appeal after sentencing on June 4  but that they were ""actively considering it"".  The two were once seen as potential leaders of a fledging movement calling for Hong Kong's secession from China. Yau was the youngest woman ever elected to the legislature. Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country  two systems"" formula which promises it a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China. But the perception that China is increasingly encroaching upon the city's freedoms has spurred a young generation of activists  many taking to the streets in months of pro-democracy protests in 2014 and some calling for outright independence. Communist Party leaders in Beijing  sensitive to calls for independence spreading to the mainland  have repeatedly slammed the movement. President Xi Jinping warned last year that any attempt to endanger China's sovereignty would be an act that crosses a ""red line"". The oath-taking incident triggered China's parliament to issue an interpretation over Hong Kong's mini-constitution while a court case over their seats was under way.  The act spurred roughly 2 000 lawyers to protest against what they called China's interference in the city's much vaunted judicial independence. Leung and Yau's disqualifications  as well as the arrest of pro-independence leader Edward Leung on rioting charges  sapped the secessionist movement of its steam. It has now largely gone underground.  (Reporting by Venus Wu  Editing by Nick Macfie) Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",politics
