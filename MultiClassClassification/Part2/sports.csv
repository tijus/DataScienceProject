Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical  mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline  cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time. When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s  we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams  made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure  there were occasional spats  but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun. But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them  according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March. Today  adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports  and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests  these experts say. None As Dr. Charles A. Popkin  pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center  said at the meeting  “Sadly  what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.” “Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy ” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport  and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.” Too often  Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries. Dr. Mininder S. Kocher  pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers  told me  “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices. In a prospective study of nearly 12 000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries  Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball  cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys  and specialization in running  swimming  soccer and volleyball  as well as cheerleading and gymnastics  increased the injury risk among girls. The injuries  reported by their mothers  all of whom are registered nurses  included stress fractures  tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament  or A.C.L.  that require surgical repair. “Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders  knees  elbows and wrists ” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing  excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly. Dr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured. But even when not injured  youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out  sometimes from sports altogether  Dr. Kocher said. None He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport  the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic  of their own choosing. None In his study of 303 college athletes  98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15  on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera  considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history  had played soccer  his favorite sport as a youth  before focusing on baseball in his late teens. “You want kids playing sports through life ” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization  at some point in high school. The more sports kids play  the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.” It’s also important  he said  for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance  quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability. Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics  tennis and fencing  kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes  only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16  and there were no early specializers among those who played football  lacrosse or field hockey. None His suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years  they’re overdoing it. “A couple of months of the year  encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer  they could switch off to tennis  if they play hockey  they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.” This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/opinion/sports-betting-final-four.html,What Americans Really Think About Sports Betting Advertisement Supported by Sporting None I’ve come to think that Venmo  PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion). But maybe that’s just me  what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country. My particular challenges aside  this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting. None That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject. None None None Credit  too  the escalation of athletes’ salaries  which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.) None None Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary  it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots. There’s no record of it  but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so  too  did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics  scholars believe  had betting scandals  involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race. More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports  cricket and baseball — both  it should be noted  invented in England. None Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise  the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby. Baseball  one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication  “A Little Pretty Pocket Book ” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime ” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America  retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games. None So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field  in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit  but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers  who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators  to shut down the pool boxes. This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby  in saloons and billiards halls  using runners to bring news back from the diamond. In fact  so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness  some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs  picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started  for obvious reasons  calling pool. As for this spring’s pools  expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account. My brackets were busted quicker than you can say Sister Jean.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/books/superfans-george-dohrmann.html,Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: Inside the Fevered Minds of Sports Fans Advertisement Supported by Q. & A. None None When did you first get the idea to write this book? It’s long been a curiosity of mine  why people were so intense about their favorite team. I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person  it was Notre Dame football  and growing up in California  the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away  but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team. None Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment  professionally and personally  for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom  but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan  I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought  if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country  that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom. What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it? I talked to Susan Harter  a renowned child psychologist  about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time  and we celebrate it  posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about  an Eagles fan  was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team. Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say  “Well  it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.” Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now. In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write? Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book  more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes  but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it  that troll behavior — while it exists  it felt like falling into a trap  just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book  but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans. Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work? None Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less. A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands  wives  brothers  sisters  roommates  girlfriends  boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior  and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons. This interview has been condensed and edited.

https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/sunday-review/college-sports-tax-dodge.html,The College Sports Tax Dodge Advertisement Supported by News Analysis None New York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago  it ran a profitable macaroni company  leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation. Today  as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up  colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much. There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships  two of the biggest income streams  which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes  collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt  the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend. None It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.” The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather  it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency. To understand how this is possible  consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference  home of the 2017 national champions in football  Clemson  and men’s basketball  North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota  Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015  it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities  as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill. But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service  the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.” “The Atlantic Coast Conference ” it said  “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes  while enriching their quality of life.” The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes. There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights  sponsorships and donations from boosters. None So an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years  the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s  the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated  declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience. None Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s  Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising  which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course  eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all  however  most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free. That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment  and the scandals that go with it  while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore  he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/bein-sports-qatar-beoutq.html,The Brazen Bootlegging of a Multibillion-Dollar Sports Network Advertisement Supported by None DOHA  Qatar — What do you do when your multibillion dollar sports network has been stolen? Executives at Qatar’s beIN Sports pondered that question last week as they stared at a bank of screens inside their sprawling headquarters here. On the night of May 2  the network’s main channel  which functions as the ESPN of the Middle East  televised the deciding game of the Champions League semifinal between A.S. Roma and Liverpool. They watched the beIN Sports feed as Liverpool scored to take an early lead. Then they watched the same play 10 seconds later on live coverage from beoutQ  a bootlegging operation seemingly based in Saudi Arabia and whose roots lie in the bitter political dispute between Qatar and a coalition of countries led by its largest neighbors  Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That night  like every night for the past few months  10 beoutQ channels were live  almost all of them screening the ostensibly exclusive and very expensive content of beIN  which owns some of the most valuable sports rights in France  Spain and Turkey. The coalition countries have subjected Qatar to a punishing blockade over the past year  accusing it of financing terrorism  disrupting regional unity by warming up to Iran and harboring fugitives. Qatar has denied the allegations. Now  one month before the start of the World Cup  the world’s most-watched sporting event and beIN’s signature property  the audacious piracy operation is positioned to illicitly deliver the tournament’s 64 games to much of the Middle East. Qatar  despite abundant resources  has been powerless to stop it. Decoder boxes embossed with the beoutQ logo have for months been available across Saudi Arabia and are now for sale in other Arab-speaking countries. A one-year subscription costs $100. A Bangladeshi worker reached by phone at Sharif Electronics in Jeddah this week said his shop has been selling the boxes for three months. “Many people buy them ” he said. As the Champions League semifinal unfolded last week  Tom Keaveny  beIN’s managing director for the Middle East who has worked in television for three decades  gathered with a half-dozen beIN engineers in a small room known as “the lab” with a mandate: Disrupt beoutQ. So far they have not been successful. Keaveny said beoutQ’s operation “takes industrial scale knowledge and ability and multimillion dollar funding.” “This isn’t someone in their bedroom ” he said. BeoutQ’s website claims its backers are a Colombian and Cuban consortium. Officials at beIN said they had spent more than $200 000 investigating the bootlegging and traced the beoutQ signal to the Riyadh-based satellite provider Arabsat. Saudi Arabia is the company’s largest investor. Government officials in Saudi Arabia and its embassy did not respond to messages seeking comment. For more than a decade  Qatar  a desert-state smaller than Connecticut that controls much of the world’s liquefied natural gas supply  has used sports to raise its profile. It will play host to the World Cup in 2022. The country’s ruling family controls the Paris Saint-Germain soccer team  one of the most prominent in Europe. BeIN has committed several billion dollars to secure exclusive rights to the biggest sports events  often paying far more than market value to ensure supremacy in the Arab world and beyond. The network has become a national emblem for the emirate  making the piracy of its broadcasts especially humiliating. “The name beoutQ is totally designed to intimidate ” said Mohammad Al-Subaie  executive director of commercial affairs for the beIN Media Group. “Being a Qatari  I really feel angry about it.” The dispute between Qatar and its neighbors has touched every aspect of life. Qatar Airways flights must avoid neighboring airspace  lengthening flight times. Families with relatives in coalition countries have to see them in another location. Some 12 000 Qatari camels grazing on Saudi land were expelled. Giant images of Qatar’s emir  Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani  have been plastered on scores of buildings in response to the blockade to stoke nationalist sentiment. “It hasn’t been an edifying conflict ” said David B. Roberts  a Gulf expert at King’s College in London. “Reports in the Saudi media that they will try to turn Qatar into an island by digging a canal along the Qatar-Saudi border and use the area to store nuclear waste sound childish.” It didn’t take long for beIN to conclude that the rogue channel was likely linked to Saudi Arabia. Shortly after the dispute began  Saudi Arabia banned the sale of beIN broadcast boxes and prohibited existing customers from paying their subscriptions to the channel. Soon  prominent Saudis  including an adviser to the royal court  began promoting the beoutQ website on social media. Then beoutQ launched in October with 10 high-definition channels. Its owners geo-locked it so only internet users in Saudi Arabia had access. The website featured all major beIN content  including soccer from around the world  N.B.A. games and marquee tennis tournaments. BeoutQ’s backers  emboldened by their ability to steal content at will  have now started to add content owned by other broadcasters beyond beIN  including fights in the Ultimate Fighting Championship mixed-martial arts league. Officials at beIN said they have been unable to find lawyers willing to pursue the case in Saudi courts  but subpoenas issued in the United States to website hosting companies helped reveal that a credit card belonging to a man named Raed Kusheim paid for hosting fees. Kusheim is the chief executive of Saudi-based Selevision  a distributor of set-top boxes and on-demand broadcast services. Kusheim  in a WhatsApp message  denied any involvement in beoutQ. He said he was involved in an unrelated legal dispute with beIN. He did not respond to a direct question about his credit card. Since October  set-top boxes have been appearing throughout Saudi Arabia  loaded with access to the channels over the internet and on satellite television. Those boxes deliver hundreds of premium channels from around the world. BeIN’s antipiracy team traced the signal to space on the Arabsat satellite. BeIN has demanded Arabsat remove the rogue channels. Arabsat — through the United States-based law firm Squire Patton Boggs — refused. It said the customer who bought the satellite space denied being involved in beoutQ. The beIN antipiracy team believes it knows how beoutQ is stealing the signal. Essentially  the website is re-airing content delivered to an individual subscriber. Since each subscriber has a unique identification number that is usually visible  known as a fingerprint  beIN engineers thought they would be able to easily identify the offending customer. However  the pirates have figured out how to hide their fingerprints. “There’s nothing else like it in the world ” Esteban Israel  beIN’s executive director of technology  said of beoutQ’s level of sophistication. “We work with all the top technology vendors  technology developers. We have our experts  we deploy state of the art technologies and we have not seen this anywhere else.” As beIN’s engineers search for a way to stop the piracy  beoutQ is flourishing. At the start of the Champions League game between A.S. Roma and Liverpool  beIN’s Keaveny noticed the logo for the forthcoming Russia World Cup had been added alongside beoutQ’s. A halftime promotion promised beoutQ’s subscribers that they would see all 64 World Cup games live. The commentary and studio analysis on beoutQ broadcasts are usually from beIN. FIFA and other governing bodies that have sold exclusive broadcast rights to beIN have supported the company’s antipiracy efforts but have generally chosen not to criticize Saudi Arabia. A group that has offered to invest $25 billion to start two new tournaments with FIFA includes Saudi investors. La Liga  Spain’s top soccer league  recently signed a lucrative sponsorship deal to loan to top Spanish teams players from Saudi Arabia’s World Cup squad. Sophie Jordan  the Paris-based general counsel for beIN’s parent company  said turning a blind eye toward piracy risked devaluing the rights. “The rights holders need to be very careful ” she said. “By the time they realize this imperils the value of the rights in the region and not stimulate competition as some might believe  it will be too late.” BeIN has filed complaints with the World Trade Organization and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation  which includes both Saudi Arabia and Qatar. “But legal time is different to business time ” Jordan said. “We are losing money every day. We will prevail  but we will prevail in three or even five years.” At beIN’s headquarters  the control room was still buzzing on the night of Liverpool’s Champions League victory as midnight neared. The broadcaster’s director of programming  Duncan Walkinshaw  imagined what resources beoutQ must have to be able to push out someone else’s channels and even give them their own commercial breaks. By the end of the week  more than 50 live games had been broadcast by beoutQ. “They’ve created a brand without any acquisitions ” he said. “It’s quite extraordinary and very wrong. We’re investing our time and effort and someone is stealing it and making it their own.” Ben Hubbard contributed reporting from Beirut.

None None None None Raulff sets out to manage the problem of form by grouping his material into four broad categories: The first delves into lived histories  examining the use of horses in cities and rural spaces  their ubiquity in human progress  and their decline as a weapon of war  the second section departs more radically from convention as it traces intellectual history  including the horse’s place in libraries  and the rise of studbooks  equine science and research  the third looks at the horse as sign and symbol for death  sexuality  terror and innocence  particularly in literature  and the final section asks ""Why the horse?"" and considers what we might have left to learn from this creature  which has lived and died in bondage since it was first domesticated. In truth it’s difficult  even naïve  to summarize the book’s organization  because as we travel deeper and deeper into these remarkable and learned sections  there is an increasing sense of the structure breaking down  of demarcations dissolving  their lack of necessity. This is due largely to the strange and beautiful way in which Raulff handles the problem of historicity and narrative. Through looping  meandering and backtracking discourse  he addresses hundreds of subjects  including philosophy  etymology  anti-Semitism  breeding  the Polish cavalry  lost sound and scent histories  theater. He unpacks 19th-century novels  paintings and monuments  as well as dozens of bleak photographs placed within the text in a manner that recalls the dreaminess of Sebald. He layers fact over myth over military anecdote over personal memory over Darwin over Napoleon over Tolstoy over Gehlen until the book resembles an oil painting of outrageous complexity  so thickly laden with paint that it would take years to scrape down to its blank canvas. None The source of this digressive  wending approach and his unwillingness to play by the rules seems  to this reviewer at least  a resistance born of integrity. Humans are obsessive storytellers and mythmakers. Commenting on historical narratives  Raulff writes  “History is written in the indicative mood  but lived and remembered in the optative — the grammatical mood of wishful thinking.” One could even say the optative is the source of the indicative nature of normative histories. As a savvy historian  Raulff refuses to capitulate to simplistic chronological organization and instead relays events without forcing them into artificial sequence. His approach feels unusual on the page  but deeply familiar  even natural  because it mimics the discursive gymnastics of the mind rather than slavishly linear modes that attempt to organize history into overly patterned or logical systems. None What may be quite obvious now is that though this book is about horses  it is just as much about thinking as a devotional act. It’s a powerful display of one writer’s willingness to train his mind with unusual care on our coexistence with an animal that has unduly borne both our “physical and metaphorical burdens.” Our world needs more writers willing to do work of this kind  work that often produces little hope of money or fame  the reward for which must be the satisfaction of fastening together rich new connections before they are lost forever. Bravo to those unwilling to let history — whatever history is — slip away unnoticed. Bravo to Ulrich Raulff. C.E.

https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/05/08/business/ap-car-nascars-future.html,"AP Source: NASCAR Memo: France Family 'Dedicated' to Sport Advertisement Supported by None CHARLOTTE  N.C. — If NASCAR is for sale  the France family isn't saying. An attempt to calm employees about the future of the struggling  family owned racing series came Tuesday from NASCAR President Brent Dewar  but his memo said only that there would be no comment on ""industry rumors."" It's long whispered that NASCAR could be on the selling block and Chairman Brian France has become dramatically less visible since the end of last season. Most public duties are now handled by Dewar  who addressed employees about a report a day earlier that Goldman Sachs had been retained to explore a potential sale for the France family. The France family  which owns a majority stake in the nation's top auto racing series  ""remains dedicated to the long term growth of our sport "" Dewar wrote in the memo obtained by The Associated Press from a person who shared it on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the topic. The memo did not specifically address any possible deal by the France family. ""For over 70 years  the France family has worked hard to invest in the sport of NASCAR  including our recent acquisitions of ARCA "" Dewar wrote  referring to the recent purchase of the Automobile Racing Series of America  a lower-tier stock car series that sometimes races in conjunction with NASCAR events. NASCAR has seen ratings and attendance decline in recent seasons and several big-name sponsors have scaled back or pulled out. Lowe's  the only sponsor seven-time champion Jimmie Johnson has had in his 18-year career  is leaving at the end of the season. Home Depot  Target  Subway  Dollar General and scores of other sponsors have already exited racing. Title sponsor Monster Energy signed just a one-year extension through 2019 and NASCAR has said it is re-evaluating its sponsorship structure. Team owners seemed surprised by Monday's report from Reuters citing unidentified sources that the family wished to explore a sale. One owner  who spoke to AP only on condition of anonymity  said France firmly told owners in recent months the series was not for sale. Two weeks earlier  at Talladega Superspeedway  a different team owner told AP he believed the family would listen to offers for NASCAR. Television ratings have continued to drop over the past decade and the retirements of Jeff Gordon  Dale Earnhardt Jr.  Tony Stewart  Danica Patrick and Carl Edwards may have contributed to fans tuning out. But at-track attendance has also suffered and the three public companies that own tracks where NASCAR races are held have all reported attendance revenue declines. Despite its woes  NASCAR remains ""one of the strongest brand franchises in America "" said Larry Chiagouris  a marketing professor at Pace University if New York. ""Seeking to get a measure of its value now is a smart idea because we are witnessing the merging of entertainment and advertising assets at a pace not seen in several years. There could be many potential buyers  particularly media conglomerates and  yes  even some of the tech titans that could incorporate NASCAR into larger marketing and media programs and initiatives."" Greg Portell  lead partner at global consulting firm A.T. Kearney  based in Chicago  said it was possible NASCAR's owners are simply getting feedback on its value. He agreed that private firms or big entertainment companies would make the most sense as a buyer  ""an AEG or an IMG."" ""From an outsider's view looking at NASCAR  their value proposition to marketers for a long time was  we have great visibility  we have great enthusiastic fans and that's why you should spend money "" he said. ""But in today's world  the value is much more around the potential to really create lifestyle marketing. So those drivers and those athletes are no different than movie entertainers or musicians  rock stars  really  and if you look at the way those businesses have gone  companies are really trying to lock up those talents in 360-degree deals. So you can start seeing how they can monetize a driver's likeness on social media  on product merchandise  not just on the brand that goes on the car."" He added: ""It would be interesting to someone who knows how to monetize stars  celebrity. ... It doesn't come along very often that you can buy a business that has scale in a very competitive world. It's not like they're buying pro bowling or the darts league or lacrosse. Even Major League Soccer  you have to build that followership. Here  they already have a followership. They reach millions of consumers. And so the question is how do you shine that up a bit and take advantage of it in a new marketing environment that really hasn't been tested by the current ownership."" NASCAR was founded in 1948 by Bill France Sr.  and handed down to his sons  Bill France Jr.  and Jim. The current structure has Bill France Jr.'s son  Brian  running NASCAR  while his daughter  Lesa  controls International Speedway Corp.  the sister company that owns many of the venues. Jim France runs the IMSA sports car series. Lesa France and Jim France remain largely behind the scenes  while Brian France has been the face of the family. The exact ownership stake has never been revealed. Because of changes made under Brian France's leadership— to the cars  the championship structure  the schedule  the rules  a television package that places some races on cable  and many other updates — the hardcore fan base views him as a polarizing figure. Brian France has taken a progressive position on diversity and widening it in NASCAR  and he wanted to ban the Confederate flag from race tracks. But he also took a handful of drivers to a rally for President Donald Trump  and later sent employees a memo separating his views from company views. Corbin Bridge  an associate at InvestmentBank.com  said the timing could be good for a sale with private equity funds eager to invest. Noting that many details are unknown  Bridge suggested a sale of NASCAR would fetch billions but fall short of the $8 billion acquisition of Formula One by Liberty Media in 2016. The impact of a sale could depend on whether the France family pulls out of NASCAR altogether  Bridge said. ""If it's a complete 100 percent sale to another party and the family walks away  that could have some interesting ramifications that aren't so positive "" he said. ""If it's a sale where the family stays on for a transition period or if select members stay on to help guide the company and the new owner  kind of helps take the company in new and exciting directions to grow the brand while staying loyal to its mission and current fan base  then it could be a pretty good play for the company and help them in the long run."" ___ AP Sports Writers Eric Olson and John Zenor contributed to this report. ___ More AP auto racing: https://racing.ap.org Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",sports
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/07/world/europe/07reuters-russia-government-nominations-mutko.html,"Russia's Mutko Set to Lose Sport in New Cabinet Post Advertisement Supported by None MOSCOW — Russian Prime Minister-designate Dmitry Medvedev on Monday nominated Vitaly Mutko  who oversaw sport at the height of Russia's doping scandal  as a deputy prime minister overseeing construction. Speaking to lawmakers from the ruling United Russia party  Medvedev announced that Mutko  a former sports minister who had been in charge of sport since 2016 as deputy prime minister  would be responsible for construction and regional politics  drawing laughter from the meeting's attendees.  ""He's experienced "" Medvedev said in the televised meeting.  ""I remind you that he worked in a region  in St. Petersburg "" he added  referring to Mutko's time as the city's deputy mayor from 1992 to 1996. Mutko has for years shrugged off scandals in Russian sport  including an independent report that Russia ran an elaborate doping cover-up scheme at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. Russia has vehemently denied the allegations.  Mutko was banned for life from the Olympics last year as part of Russia's punishment. In recent months the 59-year-old has rolled back his involvement in sport as Russia prepares to host the soccer World Cup  which kicks off next month in 11 cities.  He relinquished his position as head of the tournament's organizing committee weeks after Russia was banned from the Pyeongchang Olympics for what the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said was evidence of ""systemic manipulation"" of anti-doping procedures at the Sochi Games.  Mutko also temporarily stepped down from his position as head of the Russian Football Union. Medvedev nominated Olga Golodets as the deputy prime minister overseeing sport and culture. During President Vladimir Putin's last term  she served as deputy prime minister overseeing social policy.  Medvedev  prime minister since 2012  resigned on Monday along with the government in line with standard procedure following Putin's inauguration for a fourth term as president. Putin nominated Medvedev to run the cabinet again earlier on Monday.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/sports/olympics/womens-nordic-combined.html,Desperately Seeking Skiers for a Budding Olympic Sport Advertisement Supported by None Women box at the Olympics. They pole-vault and snowboard and play rugby. But one sport in which women do not participate is the little-known winter event known as Nordic combined. The International Olympic Committee  which has for years made equality of participation by gender a goal  wants to change that. So a dictate to F.I.S.  the global skiing federation  and national teams went out: Get those women’s Nordic combined programs going. That was easier said than done. Nordic combined requires athletes to both ski jump and cross-country ski. Although some junior programs are out there  for the most part female Nordic combined specialists just don’t exist. “There aren’t that many participants right now ” said Luke Bodensteiner  chief of sport for U.S. Ski and Snowboard  the national governing body. “It hasn’t really developed all that naturally. The I.O.C. said: ‘We need gender balance across all our sports. Otherwise the future prospects of Nordic combined are bleak.’” So the United States arranged its first national championship for women’s Nordic combined in October. Two athletes showed up. “Development has probably gone less quickly than F.I.S. would like to see it ” Bodensteiner said. Men’s Nordic combined dates to the first Winter Games in 1924  but the women’s sport is in its infancy. It is not part of the Pyeongchang Games. But in all likelihood  ready or not  it will be on the Olympic menu in 2022 in Beijing. Its sudden emergence is giving athletes and federations something of a free shot at Olympic medals. The winner of the two-woman competition  and the first United States national champion  was Nina Lussi  23  a ski jumper. “I have a bit of a background in Nordic combined ” said Lussi  a native of Lake Placid  N.Y.  where the competition was held. “We had Nordic combined races at the junior level up to the age of about 16. Although the cross-country aspect is not my favorite part.” At the nationals  Lussi easily defeated her opponent  Gabby Armstrong  in the ski jumping portion. As a result  she started the cross-country race with a lead of four and a half minutes. Though she skied almost three minutes slower than Armstrong  Lussi held on for the win. Because the event came before significant snowfall in Lake Placid  the cross-country race was held using roller skis. “I took some lessons  ‘learn to roller ski for dummies ’” Lussi said. “I was having trouble breathing on a very steep uphill. Definitely my lungs were thanking me when I was finished.” As for the small field  “I was disappointed ” she said. “I thought it was a good opportunity for the juniors. To not have the entries was disappointing.” So far  ski jumpers are the target athletes for the event  more so than cross-country skiers. “Jumping’s pretty hard to learn ” Bodensteiner said. “I don’t foresee much transfer from cross-country skiing.” He noted that the scoring generally favors jumpers  and that male Nordic combined athletes tend to be “prototypical ski jumpers.” The tentative plan is to scale up women’s Nordic combined rapidly. The first Continental Cup event  the level below World Cup  was held in January in Norway  with 14 entrants (Armstrong placed 12th). A World Cup will follow in 2020  with a world championship in 2021 and the Olympics in 2022. Time is short. “It really has to be done  and it’s the right thing to do ” said Silke Tegethof  the media coordinator for Nordic combined with F.I.S. ”Countries like Germany  Austria and Norway  they started working on their development program up to four years ago ” Lussi said. “We need to get a kick in that direction. We have great hope in Tara.” Tara Geraghty-Moats  24  is exactly the kind of athlete who could excel in the sport for the United States. She is a top-level ski jumper who has also competed in cross-country skiing and biathlon. She would have been a third participant in the national championships but missed them because of a broken arm. Geraghty-Moats said of the dawn of women’s Nordic combined: “It’s so exciting. I’ve been waiting about 13 years. When I was 10 or 11  people said wouldn’t it be cool because you’re so good” at Nordic combined. “Had there been women’s Nordic combined when I was younger  I would have been a Nordic combined athlete.” She said that many ski jumpers could have the ability to succeed at Nordic combined because of their training background. “Ski jumpers  for sure  they try to get you on cross-country skis ” she said. “It helps with balance and coordination.” One complication of Nordic combined is that the ideal body types for the two elements of the discipline tend to be different. “Ski jumping  you want to be light  cross-country  you want to be fast ” Geraghty-Moats said. Ideal Nordic combined athletes  she said  would be “cross-country skiers with leaner builds.” Women’s Nordic combined is taking an unconventional path to the Olympics. It is not a sport that has bubbled up from the grass roots to force its way into the Games. Instead a top-down edict about gender equality has caused national federations to scramble to start programs. Women are almost certain to have Nordic combined as a medal sport at the Olympics in four years. The opportunity is there  it’s just a matter of who takes it. Bodensteiner said he believed that the lure of the Games would be enough. “Once they start awarding Olympic medals ” he predicted. “People will start chasing them.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/sports/final-four-loyola-chicago-porter-moser.html,The Coach  the Rivalry and the Stolen Blazer Advertisement Supported by None As pranks go  the case of the missing sport coat is a doozy. It has it all: a crime but no conviction  video evidence but no definitive proof  damage inflicted and reparations paid. Its main characters include a former N.B.A. guard  a Final Four-bound coach and a mysterious accomplice (and perhaps a few more). And 15 years later  Porter Moser still swears he had nothing to do with it. “That is amazing ” Moser said playfully when asked about the incident Thursday. “The higher platform you go  the more your closet of things that happen  they’re going to dig up. Wow. You get the award.” None It all began in 2002  when Moser was the second-year coach at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock and engaged in an overheated rivalry with Monte Towe  the former N.B.A. guard then coaching the University of New Orleans. During a tight game at New Orleans’s Lakefront Arena  Moser and Towe started jawing at each other and  according to Towe  Moser used profane language. “I turned to my assistant  Patrick Harrington  and said  ‘What the heck is going on here?’” Towe recalled in a telephone interview this week. “Then I did something bad I shouldn’t have done.” During the postgame handshakes after New Orleans won  Towe slapped Moser’s hand away. In seconds  all the players and the assistant coaches joined in the fracas. The slap gave way to shoves. There was almost certainly more profane language. “It got a little heated ” recalled Chris Peterson  the former athletic director at Arkansas-Little Rock and Moser’s boss at the time. Order was eventually restored  but the hard feelings lingered. The next season  New Orleans traveled to Little Rock  where the local news media whipped up fans by retelling the story about Towe and the previous year’s incident. At some point late in the first half  Towe noticed that his black sport coat  which he had draped over the back of his chair as he usually did during games  was missing. “Apparently  with no part on my part  he had taken off his sport jacket and put it on his thing  all he had was a T-shirt ” Moser said  “and somebody walked by  grabbed it  took it.” Just before the second half began  and with the jacket still nowhere in sight  Towe approached Peterson in the stands and told him  in a stern tone  that someone had stolen his sport coat. According to Towe  Peterson was not overly sympathetic. “He said  ‘Don’t worry about it  just coach your team ’” Towe said. A little over an hour later  the Privateers packed up to head back to New Orleans — without a win  and without Towe’s jacket. Once they got back on campus  Towe and his staff quickly set to work scanning a videotape of the game  not so much to see who missed their box-out assignments  but to find evidence of what happened to the missing sport coat. A man sitting behind the New Orleans bench quickly raised their suspicions. Sure enough  in one sequence up the court  the jacket was on Towe’s chair. But when the ball came back the other way and the camera scanned the bench  it was gone. “We never saw the guy actually take it ” Towe said  laughing at the memory  “but what we saw later confirmed our suspicions.” What they saw  Towe said  was that when the game ended  Moser went straight over to the prime suspect behind Towe’s seat and shook his hand. The man had opportunity and motive  and in the New Orleans basketball offices  that handshake proved Moser’s complicity. Towe called Peterson. “Not only did it happen ” he told Moser’s boss  “we have it on tape.” Moser has his own theory. On Thursday  he said a radio station that had stirred up the fans ahead of the New Orleans game had been behind the theft — “The radio station was trying to auction off ‘I got Monte Towe’s sport jacket.’” Peterson appeased Towe by promising an investigation  and he quickly solved the caper. But it got worse: Somehow the jacket had ended up in a Little Rock fraternity house  where the members had urinated on it. “The frat boys apparently had a good time with that jacket ” Peterson said. Peterson recovered the defiled jacket  had it dry-cleaned and sent it back to Towe along with an apology and a $150 gift certificate to a New Orleans restaurant. The commissioner of the Sun Belt Conference even intervened  ordering both coaches to write emails promising to end it there. According to Peterson  the emails were exceedingly brief  but the peace held. Moser left Little Rock after the season (not because of the incident  Peterson said) to coach at Illinois State and then went to St. Louis as an assistant before moving to Loyola. The Ramblers play Michigan in a national semifinal on Saturday. “Moser did a great job there and he’s doing a great job now ” Towe said. “I hope they win.” Towe coached at New Orleans until 2006  then worked as an assistant at his alma mater  North Carolina State  and Middle Tennessee State before retiring. These days he plays a lot of tennis and golf and serves as a coach at Oak Hall High School in Gainesville  Fla. He remembered taking his wife for a nice dinner to the Palace Café  on Peterson’s dime. But whatever happened to Exhibit A? “I wore it the next game ” Towe said. “They have good dry cleaners in Little Rock.” Marc Tracy contributed reporting from San Antonio.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/sports/football/roger-goodell-nfl-draft.html,How Big Can the N.F.L. Draft Get? Advertisement Supported by On Pro Football None The N.F.L. is sometimes derided as the No Fun League for its oh-so-serious ways. But when it comes to making money  Commissioner Roger Goodell and the 32 owners experience plenty of joy. None [Read our analysis of all 32 picks in Round 1] It also makes one forget that just a few years ago  the three-day celebration of college football turning into newly minted millionaires was held in Manhattan at the rather dowdy Radio City Music Hall. Sure  there were red carpet arrivals for the players and fans milling around midtown in jerseys of their favorite teams. But the event was limited by the confines of the city filled with a thousand distractions. The event barely registered with the locals. So when the N.F.L. couldn’t resolve a scheduling conflict with the venue it struck on the idea of taking the draft on the road. It was an inspired solution. The draft went to Chicago for two years  then to Philadelphia last year  and now to North Texas  the cradle of 21st century football  where it is taking place in a stadium  not a hotel or theater  with room for tens of thousands of more fans at the festival-like set up outside the building. That is a long way from the ballroom of the New York Sheraton  where they draft was held in 1980  the first year ESPN televised it  and it shows just how much the league has evolved from the business of sport to the business of spectacle. “At the end of the day  it was  how do we make it as accessible as we can to the fans  and something we couldn’t make at Radio City ” said Peter O’Reilly  the senior vice president of events at the league. “Nothing is cookie cutter. It’s about what will be iconic and highlight the city.” The N.F.L.  of course  didn’t grow so large by leaving money on the table. So it has deployed its tried-and-true strategy of dangling the supposed glamour of pro football in front of cities eager to cozy up to the nation’s biggest sports league. In return  the league has received subsidies  police escorts and city permits. The N.F.L. doesn’t charge fans to attend  but sponsors line up to have their brands plastered on the event  which this year may surpass last year’s record of 250 000 attendees. For the first time this year  three networks — ESPN  the NFL Network and now Fox Sports — will broadcast the proceedings. More than 2 000 media passes were issued this year  more than double the 904 issued in 2010  the first year the draft was held in prime time. A supersized draft costs millions of dollars to produce  but O’Reilly said it now essentially breaks even. Now that the draft is fully unshackled from New York  where it took place for nearly a half-century  the N.F.L. intends to continue taking its show on the road. Twenty other cities have expressed interest in playing host to the event in the coming years  a list that has been narrowed to five finalists: Canton/Cleveland  Denver  Kansas City  Las Vegas and Nashville. At the owners’ meeting at the end of May  two of the five cities will be chosen to host the 2019 and 2020 Drafts. For Butch Spyridon  the president of the Nashville Convention and Visitors Corporation  jumping through all the hoops to try to bring the draft to the Music City was a no-brainer. Nashville has a well-earned reputation as a party town  with an easy-to-navigate downtown. The city has good weather in April  and is within driving distance of several N.F.L. cities  including Atlanta  New Orleans and Cincinnati. “For me  it always felt like something Nashville would embrace ” said Spyridon  who traveled to New York to make a presentation to the league in December. Spyridon figures that his organization will have to spend about $3 million to host the event. Roughly half that money will come from local companies pitching in. The Titans might pitch in  too. But visitors to Nashville will spend between $5 million and $10 million  and the amount of exposure for the city on television would be hard to replicate with another event. “It builds our resume of our ability to host events ” he said. Officials in Arlington are saying much the same thing. Though many fans will stay in Dallas  Fort Worth and surrounding cities  the hotels in Arlington have received 25 percent more bookings this week than at the same time last year. The 15 percent tax per night on hotel stays will generate extra revenue for the city. More money will be spent in shops and restaurants. “It’s more than an N.F.L. game  it’s more like the N.C.A.A. championship ” said Mayor Jeff Williams of Arlington. “It’s not just a single day  there are things happening all week.” With an entire stadium to work with  the N.F.L. created seats for fans of each team  giving the field the look of a political convention. Hundreds of other fans stood in standby lanes waiting to get on the floor. Thousands of fans stuffed into the upper decks. Most seemed happy just to secure a ticket  and had spent heavily to get to the draft. Tyler Ward  43  a devoted Seattle Seahawks fan  spent about $1 000 to fly from Stuttgart  Germany  to Dallas. He wore a “12” jersey. Asked why he traveled so far to attend his first draft  he screamed  “Seahawks! I guess this explains everything.” Other fans were happy to see the draft move out of New York. Jan Lopez  26  flew from Boston. He received tickets from the New England Patriots because he is on the wait-list for season tickets. “I love that they switch it up from the New York stuff ” he said. “Those guys had it in New York how many years?” Cleveland Penn flew with his wife from Charlotte and plans to attend the draft all three days. Wearing a Ryan Tannehill Miami Dolphins jersey  Penn said the expense of the trip was worth it because the exhibits at N.F.L. Experience were fun and because of the thrill of finding out how his favorite team might improve. “Everyone’s in first place at the draft ” he said. “There’s no losers on this night.” Marc Tracy contributed reporting from Arlington  Tex.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/sports/ncaafootball/national-signing-day.html,On National Signing Day  Football Recruits Discover a New Tactic: Patience Advertisement Supported by On College Football None Brock Purdy was a good enough high school quarterback to attract attention through the fall from several well regarded  if not top-tier  college programs. During his senior season at Perry High School outside Phoenix  Purdy received scholarship offers from New Mexico State and U.N.L.V.  which compete in so-called Group of Five conferences — in the same Football Bowl Subdivision as the major powers  but a rung below power leagues like the Southeastern Conference and the Big Ten. In December  Boise State  the most successful Group of Five team of the past decade  asked Purdy to become a Bronco next fall. But when college football’s inaugural early signing period — the first chance for players to sign binding letters of intent — opened on Dec. 20 and slammed shut two days later  Purdy held off on making his choice. Instead  he pushed back his decision to the traditional February national signing day  on Wednesday. “He was really excited about the Boise State offer ” Purdy’s father  Shawn  said. But  he added  “Brock is a very  very patient kid.” After that early signing period  the pool of top pro-style quarterbacks narrowed considerably  and top teams gained more precise senses of who comprised their future freshman classes — and what they still needed. And suddenly  Purdy was getting calls from bigger programs. By January  Purdy had received offers from Central Florida  which finished last season ranked sixth nationally  Illinois  Iowa State  Texas A&M  and Alabama. “He never wavered ” Shawn Purdy said. “And his patience has paid off.” None “It serves as an opportunity for students who made a commitment to a school to kind of call the question  and same thing for the school ” said Jon Steinbrecher  the Mid-American Conference commissioner  who helped formulate the policy as a member of Division I’s football oversight committee. But a striking consequence of the new early signing period has been the unlikely power it has given players who wait it out. “The players are holding a lot of the leverage ” said Brandon Huffman  the national recruiting editor for 247Sports. Cornerback Olaijah Griffin and wide receiver Chris Olave  to take two examples  both supplemented the enviable lists of suitors chasing them before the early period with several more who came in after it  including Clemson  Florida State  Oregon State  Nebraska and Tennessee. “It gives the schools an opportunity to evaluate kids who might have been overlooked ” said Tommy Tuberville  the former Auburn coach who is now an ESPN analyst. Before this cycle  a team with  say  20 scholarships to hand out to next year’s class had to wait until signing day to know for sure how many players it had signed. This year  that same team might have wrapped up commitments from 14 of its first-choice players in December  that allowed it to enter January and February knowing exactly how many spaces it has left  and which positions it most urgently needs to fill. “It’s given everyone an opportunity to recalibrate and reset their board ” Huffman said. Julius Irvin  a safety from Anaheim  Calif.  was recruited throughout the past year  with official offers not only from Pacific-12 teams but also from Notre Dame and Michigan. He had hoped to make a decision by the December period and sign then  said his high school coach  Scott Meyer  but his mother fell ill and he postponed his plans. After the December period  new offers came in from Florida  Penn State and Alabama. The Crimson Tide  the defending national champion  made a late move for Irvin after learning for certain following January’s national championship game that they would be losing two top junior safeties to the N.F.L. None “For some of those big schools playing in those big bowl games after the December signing period  it pays to hold off ” Meyer said. The new early signing period also gives new coaches  typically not hired until late November or later  time to adjust their programs’ recruiting priorities. Many of the active teams recently — Central Florida  Florida  Florida State  Nebraska  Tennessee — have new head coaches. Even Alabama  where Nick Saban is entering his 12th season  had turnover in the past month at both offensive and defensive coordinator. But another consequence of the rule change could be the continuation of an old college football theme: the rich getting richer. As top teams receive a second window to focus on fewer roster spots  they can bore down on prospects who fit their positional needs  giving themselves a shot at sniffing out diamonds in the rough they otherwise would have missed. As a result  said Huffman  “now you’re seeing more recruitment of lower-level kids  because they’re the best available.” There were teams  he added  “that thought  ‘Hey  we’re going to be able to sneak this kid by ’ and thought they would get their targets avoided because they weren’t as high-profile.” None Future prospects are doubtlessly watching closely. Like  say  Purdy’s backup quarterback at Perry High: his younger brother  Chubba. Chubba Purdy is taller than Brock  and he and his father are already thinking about his own recruitment. Said Shawn Purdy  “We know what to do now.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports

Yet investors keep lining up to help start new football leagues. On Tuesday  the longtime N.F.L. executive Bill Polian and the television and movie producer Charlie Ebersol became the latest entrepreneurs to join the fray when they unveiled plans for the Alliance of American Football. There have been several short-lived football leagues before  including the United Football League  United States Football League and XFL. Like others before them  Polian and Ebersol say they have a formula for success. They have acquired investments from Silicon Valley firms that will allow their eight-team league to start playing a week after the Super Bowl in February 2019. Their partners include CBS  which will show a few games on its main channel and some on its cable network. They will also launch a smartphone app on which fans will be able to stream games and play fantasy football. The league will also aim for two-and-a-half hour games (N.F.L. games generally last at least three hours). To achieve that  there will be no kickoffs or extra points — only 2-point plays — and a 30-second play clock  as opposed to the N.F.L.’s 45-second clock. There will also be no television timeouts  which will lead to about 60 percent fewer commercials. None None Ebersol declined to say whether the league would receive a media rights fee from CBS. But he said there was enough funding to get the league on its feet. He said the league would appeal to the tens of millions of fans who play fantasy football but must stop playing once the N.F.L. season ends.

He will be joining “Monday Night Football” as an analyst. At a news conference on Thursday afternoon attended by many teammates  an emotional Witten said: “I can only hope that the men and women in these hallways will say I was a decent man  tried to do things the right way and was dependable.” “I was never the most talented  never the flashiest ” he said. “I relied on grit.” Of his decision to retire he said  “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.” A third-round pick out of Tennessee  Witten  35  was an ironman at tight end  playing 15 games in his rookie season and 16 every season thereafter. He had 11 Pro Bowl selections  including last season. He caught 1 152 passes for more than 12 000 yards  both Cowboys records. He ranks fourth in the N.F.L. in catches behind Jerry Rice  Tony Gonzalez and Larry Fitzgerald. He was also known as a strong run blocker. Cowboys Coach Jason Garrett once called him “the most dedicated footballer I’ve ever been around.” Of the many great plays he made over the years for the Cowboys  one of the most remembered came in 2007 when his helmet was knocked off after a reception against the Philadelphia Eagles and he ran another 30 yards without it. But Witten played in an era when the Cowboys had more playoff disappointments than successes. His career playoff record is 2-6  and he never got to a conference championship game. Though Witten had five touchdowns last season  his receptions (63) and his yardage (560) were both the lowest since his rookie season. None That means the Cowboys have lost their top two receivers in terms of catches last season. Still on the team are Terrance Williams and Cole Beasley. The Cowboys also signed Allen Hurns from the Jacksonville Jaguars in free agency last month. The Cowboys did draft a tight end last month  Dalton Schultz of Stanford  in the fourth round  as well as two wide receivers. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports

He hopes that Waylon doesn’t play the game at all. Advertisement Jelani Cobb  the New Yorker writer and educator  said he would not be watching on Sunday  but his reason had nothing to do with the game’s violence and potential for life-threatening injury. He is not watching because he believes Colin Kaepernick  the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback  was blackballed by the N.F.L. for protesting for social justice when he chose to take a knee for the national anthem before games. Many Americans say they have been turned off by on-field protests during games (61 percent  according to the Burson-Marsteller survey)  but most say they plan to watch the game even if there are protests.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/sports/cricket/australia-cricket-scandal.html,Astonishing Admission of Cheating Rocks Australian Cricket Advertisement Supported by None None There is little chance that Steve Smith  the Australia captain and one of the finest players in the country’s history  will win that award anytime soon. On Saturday  Smith acknowledged concocting a plan to tamper with a cricket ball during a series in South Africa  in an attempt to gain an unfair and illegal advantage  a revelation that has stunned a sport that has never been reluctant to seize the moral high ground. The development embarrassed the team  brought outrage from fans across the spectrum — including from Australia’s prime minister — and will almost certainly have long-term consequences for the team and its players. None Bancroft’s actions — which have parallels in baseball  where pitchers have been known to use saliva or a nail file to manipulate the ball — were caught by cameras during the third day of a five-day match in South Africa. Cricket Australia  the sport’s governing body in the country  removed Smith as captain for the remainder of the match  an unprecedented decision. He was also stripped of his match fee by the International Cricket Council  the global organization that oversees the sport  and was banned for one Test match. As senior officials from Cricket Australia flew to South Africa to investigate  it was unclear whether Smith would ever captain the country again. None Adam Gilchrist  a former Australia international  said his country’s cricket team had become the “laughingstock” of the sporting world. An acknowledgment of cheating would be notable in any sport. But it is particularly shocking in cricket  which has always professed a certain moral sanctimony. None The notion of “the spirit of cricket” is regularly invoked at all levels of the game and the International Cricket Council has an award named after that notion to celebrate acts of sportsmanship. It is a comforting image for the sport  but it is also a myth. The game has seen gambling and match-fixing scandals from its earliest years  in the 18th century. Corruption  among both players and officials  continues to haunt the game  there are also concerns about bad behavior on the field from players and the threat of doping. The logic of ball tampering — what Bancroft is accused of doing — is to try to alter the surface of the ball so it is more likely to act unpredictably when bowled  making it harder for the batsmen to hit. None In the last 25 years  international cricketers have been punished for tampering with the ball in many ways — including keeping dirt in their pockets  rubbing a cough lozenge on the surface  scuffing the ball on the zips of their trousers and even biting the ball  which the Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi was found guilty of in 2010. None And when Australia last hosted South Africa in a series in 2016  the South Africa captain Faf du Plessis was caught sucking mints and then using his saliva to polish the ball on one side  again to try to alter the flight and bounce. He was later fined his match fee. The incidents highlight how hard it is to eliminate ball-tampering  which is notoriously difficult to prove — adding saliva is legal  but doing so while sucking mints is not. Some have suggested that the laws should be revised  perhaps by legalizing some aspects of treating the ball  like using saliva after sucking candy or mints  that are especially hard to police. Yet the actions of Bancroft — and  especially  Smith in instructing him — are seen as falling well beyond the normal ambiguity of the law. The Australians’ actions amounted to nothing less than flagrant cheating. Even worse  perhaps  is the sense of what it revealed about the team  adding to simmering concerns about how far the Australian side are prepared to go in pursuit of an edge. During the recent Ashes victory against England  Australia came under criticism for what is known as sledging — the cricket equivalent of trash-talking — and for bowling the ball hard into the ground to make it bounce in the direction of the opponent’s head. James Sutherland  Cricket Australia’s chief executive  said  “All Australians  like us  want answers.” David Richardson  the chief executive of the International Cricket Council  said that senior Australian players had acted “clearly contrary to the spirit of the game” and that the cheating risked “causing significant damage to the integrity of the match  the players and the sport itself.” For those involved  the financial consequences  as well the moral outrage  may be felt for years to come. On Monday  Smith announced that he was resigning as captain of the Rajasthan Royals  a team in the Indian Premier League that recently signed him to a contract that would pay him nearly $2 million a year. None None Perhaps the most poignant reaction was that of Jim Maxwell  considered the voice of Australian cricket. On air during the third Test match  Maxwell fought back tears. “I’ve started to become more and more offended by the arrogance of some of the players in the way they behave ” he said  terming the ball tampering “so blatant  so stupid  naïve and immature.” In Cape Town  Australia’s humiliation extended to the result. The side lost by 322 runs to go 2-1 down in the four-match series. As they head to Johannesburg for the final match  Australia are playing for much more than just a tie in the series.

None There were protests inside and outside the stadium for the opening home game in Chennai on Tuesday. Farmers were joined by activists and some film stars. The police closed roads to the stadium  and at least 20 protesters were arrested. Inside  a pair of shoes was thrown on the field  although no harm was done  and the South African player Faf du Plessis amiably tossed the shoes back in the crowd. None Cricket officials were concerned about the safety of the players  and police officials were concerned about their ability to manage continuing protests. None Compounding the controversy was that the game was the first in Chennai in three years. The team is coming off a suspension after corruption and match-fixing charges. That lack of recent cricket in Chennai prompted a high level of anticipation for the game and an enthusiastic capacity crowd. Chennai’s team includes overseas stars like Dwayne Bravo of Trinidad and Shane Watson of Australia  as well as M.S. Dhoni  a former captain of the Indian national team. Chennai won the game when Ravindra Jadeja hit a six on the next-to-last ball  and moved to 2-0 on the season. In recent years  Chennai’s sports scene has been marked more by the absence of I.P.L. cricket than by its presence. In addition to the ban for 2016 and 2017  Chennai’s home games in 2014 were moved to Ranchi  1 000 miles away  because of a dispute between the stadium and the state.

Bangladesh had been scheduled to play two tests and three one day internationals Down Under later this year but there was no mention of it when Australia's schedule for the 2018-19 home season was published at the end of last month. ""They have told us this series is not financially viable due to the off-season "" chief executive Nizam Uddin Chowdhury told Reuters.  ""This is really disappointing. All the series we hosted were not always profitable. If we can conduct them  we would expect the other cricket boards  especially bigger ones like Cricket Australia  to do the same.

It’s been my life  and I hope it will be again.” None “I don’t blame anyone ” Mr. Smith said. “I’m the captain of the Australian team  and I take responsibility for the actions that happened.” Cricket Australia  the sport’s governing body in the country  removed Mr. Smith as captain and barred him and the vice captain  David Warner  from play for a year. A third conspirator  Cameron Bancroft  a batsman  was barred for nine months. The team’s head coach  Darren Lehmann  who was not implicated in the plot  announced on Thursday that he would resign  wiping tears from his eyes as he said goodbye. None For Australia in particular  it is difficult to overstate the impact of the scandal. The captain of the national cricket team is considered by many to be the most important job besides prime minister and Mr. Smith’s error in judgment has led news reports all week  drawing criticism from other athletes  fans  television personalities and politicians. None But Australia tends to see itself as a model of upstanding sportsmanship — and the intensity of the response here reveals the degree to which Australia sees itself through the lens of sports. Mr. Smith’s fall from grace has led many Australians to question whether the image they have of themselves and their country — as a place of the “fair go” and a healthy understated sense of competition — is actually exaggerated. What if Australia is actually a “win at all costs” kind of country? What if its heroes are cheats? And if cricket is corrupt  what else is? “Cricket is so deeply woven into the history and fabric of Australian life  recent events have caused nothing less than a gaping wound on the national soul ” said Peter FitzSimons  an author and former professional rugby player who frequently writes about sports  culture and politics. “As important as baseball to Americans? No  more so.” Mr. Smith  who is still regarded as one of Australia’s most talented players  now seems to be doing everything he can to accept responsibility and plead for mercy. His apology  with the image of his scrunched up face and obvious regret  has been shared countless times online  and many Australians are beginning to shift from scolding to empathy. None Mr. Smith was a hero to children  and with many of them now struggling with how to account for his misbehavior  the dynamic has at times felt parental: Australians are seizing on what is clearly a “teachable moment.” Asked at the news conference whether he had a message for young fans  Mr. Smith said: “Firstly  I’m deeply sorry. I love the game of cricket  I love entertaining young kids  I love kids wanting to play the great game of cricket that I love.” “The two other things ” he added  “is that anytime you think about making a questionable decision  think about who you’re affecting — you’re affecting your parents.” Damien Cave reported from Sydney  and Rick Gladstone from New York.

Ireland will become the first team to debut in the test format since Bangladesh in 2000  after being awarded full member status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) last June along with Afghanistan. The benefits of being a full member are more likely  especially initially  to be felt more keenly off the pitch though as the game seeks to earn mainstream status in Ireland. ""We have done things in the opposite way to the norm "" Deutrom told Reuters in a telephonic interview from Dublin. ""Normally a game becomes a major sport in their country first and they then use that to create success on an international stage. ""But Irish cricket has become successful on the international stage initially  punching above our weight  and we are using that to hopefully become a mainstream sport in Ireland. ""Will test cricket be the format to bring people to the sport in Ireland? The answer is probably no. But we wouldn't anticipate playing more than one or two test matches at home per year  probably up until 2022. Then we can look again thereafter.  ""We are adopting a less-is-more approach  to develop a brand of hosting test cricket without it becoming too financially unsustainable."" Deutrom says the ICC full member status provides certainty to the board's commercial partners  an important step forward in developing the game in the country. ""The tangible benefits are more funding from the ICC and the ability to guarantee more fixtures across all three formats in the coming years that will improve our players. ""We have a very good diet of multi-format cricket coming up  of which the mainstay will be the One-Day International league. We will have 60 to 65 fixtures over the next four or five years  and that is just at home. ""If you are relying on one or two standalone fixtures in a season then that is never enough to generate consistent spectator and media interest. ""We can now go forward with some certainty to provide our commercial partners with multiple opportunities through the coming seasons. Broadcasters also want to develop a relationship with a visible brand and playing across multiple formats will allow for that. ""By virtue of all of these things  cricket will become more visible in Ireland  which will hopefully get kids playing the sport in greater numbers. Having the opportunity to wear the green shirt of Ireland as a professional international sportsperson … few major sports can offer that."" Deutrom says public interest in Ireland's first ever test has been ""good""  with media interest ""phenomenal"".  ""We were a bit unsure about how many temporary seats to put up (in Malahide) as we are trying to bed down an unfamiliar format to many in Ireland  but we settled on 6 300. ""Tickets sales for day one (as of May 9) were 5 100  for day two 4 000 and day three around 2 000. We had a four-page pull-out in Ireland's biggest-selling national newspaper  the Independent  last weekend which has been part of a phenomenal media response to the test.""  There is a potential threat facing Ireland with the exit of Britain from the European Union that will mean their cricketers become less accessible to English counties. That presents a problem on two fronts – the lack of exposure for the players to quality cricket to help with their development and the potential that some may choose 'club over country' if that option is open to them through lineage. Deutrom believes the solution lies in strengthening Ireland's domestic competitions and that is something that has been under way for a few years now. ""We have been thinking about this as far back as 2012 "" he reveals. ""The more we were taking players out of county cricket  it became a tug-of-love for the players between their bread and butter and developing the national team. ""So we put our inter-provincial structure in place in 2013  which was actually the revival of an old structure between our three primary provinces. We added Munster to that in the Twenty20 format to give us four teams. ""So we had a greater quantity of cricket being played in Ireland  the next step is to improve the quality and with players less likely to feature for English county sides after 2019  that should improve as well.""

Langer was named on Thursday as the replacement for Lehmann  who resigned in the wake of the Cape Town scandal even though he was cleared of wrongdoing by Cricket Australia. Former captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner are serving year-long bans while Cameron Bancroft has been suspended for nine months over the incident. ""I'm just so pleased that Australian cricket is going to be in such good hands "" Lehmann told cricket.com.au. ""He's got the best job in the world  and I know it's a job that I'll miss because I loved every minute of it. ""But this is a time that Australian cricket needs to move forward and they couldn't have a better person to lead them now."" Langer  a gritty opening batsman who played in some of Australia's greatest teams  has been appointed coach of the test  one-day and T20 sides for the next four years. He will also be part of a players' review aimed at improving a team culture and conduct that former players and media pundits have long criticised as boorish and out of step with public expectations. Lehmann  who took Australia to the 2015 World Cup title  consecutive Ashes victories at home and to the top of the world test and ODI rankings  said Langer had to find a formula to be successful playing the right way.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/01/sports/cricket/01reuters-cricket-australia-review.html,"Cricket-Watson and Bailey to Join Captains in Australia Review Advertisement Supported by None MELBOURNE — Former test players Shane Watson and George Bailey will join Australia captains Tim Paine and Rachael Haynes on a panel tasked with drafting a charter of behaviour in the wake of the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa  Cricket Australia said on Tuesday. The player review  to be overseen by former test opener Rick McCosker  would also include fast bowler Pat Cummins and Darren Lehmann's replacement as coach of the men's team  CA said. The team's culture has been under the microscope since batsman Cameron Bancroft was spotted by cameras trying to scuff up the ball with a piece of sandpaper during the third test against South Africa in Cape Town. The scandal saw then-captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner banned for a year  with Bancroft suspended for nine months. Lehmann  who was appointed in 2013  was cleared of wrongdoing by CA but resigned as coach in March more than 12 months before his contract was up.  CA have also appointed Dr Simon Longstaff  executive director of the Sydney-based Ethics Centre  to lead a separate independent review into the governing body. The Ethics Centre led a review into the culture at the Australian Olympic Committee last year after multiple allegations of bullying rocked the organisation. “We understand and share the disappointment of fans and the broader Australian community about these events (in South Africa) "" CA chairman David Peever said in a statement. ""The board is determined to do all we can to prevent such events from ever happening again. ""The reviews will commence immediately  and we fully anticipate being able to begin implementing findings before the start of the 2018-19 cricket season."" PERSONAL REDEMPTION The Australian Cricketers' Association  which fought a bitter campaign with CA over a new pay deal for players last year  said it welcomed an investigation into CA's culture and governance. But the players' union complained it was not invited to co-chair the independent review. It also said it had a number of concerns over the transparency of the review process and whether players would be held to higher standards than those set out by the International Cricket Council. ""We are concerned that our players may be subject to conditions which could be different from those that apply to players from other countries against which they play "" ACA president Greg Dyer said in a statement. ""Changes to player behaviour  expectations or sanctions must be aligned with those which would be handed down to players on both sides of international cricket matches."" Australia's players have long prided themselves on playing aggressive cricket and often spoken of ""pushing the line"" of acceptable behaviour. Former players and pundits  however  have criticised the team for relentless sledging of opponents and other boorish conduct on field.  CA CEO James Sutherland  who has led the governing body since 2001  has faced calls to step down from his role for failing to improve the team's standards of behaviour as the Australian public has grown increasingly uncomfortable with their conduct on the field. ""I haven't thought about (resigning as CEO) and I really see the responsibility I have to push through this and deal with the situation "" he told local radio station SEN on Tuesday. ""This is an opportunity for the game to get better and it will be better through this."" Sutherland also said that Warner  Smith and Bancroft could ""absolutely"" win their places back on the Australian team once they had done their time. ""I think everyone deserves their chance and their own personal redemption story is very much in their own hands now "" he added.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/02/sports/steve-smith-cricket-australia.html,Australian Cricket Has Its Own Deflategate  and a Nation Reels Advertisement Supported by None It is as if Lionel Messi or LeBron James were banned for a year for cheating. But in this case the superstar is Steve Smith  one of the best cricketers in the world and the captain of the national team in Australia  where fair play is prized and cricket is a national obsession. On Thursday  Smith returned to Australia  which was still reeling from the scandal and demanding answers over his failing to intervene in a ball-tampering scheme while on tour in South Africa and initially lying about it to sports officials and the news media. None “I know I will regret this for the rest of my life ” Smith said  fighting back tears at a news conference in Sydney. “I made a serious error of judgment and I now understand the consequences. It was a failure of my leadership. I will do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused.” But to understand the fall of Smith  who was barred from all Australian international and domestic cricket for 12 months and from the 2018 season of the Indian Premier League  it is necessary to understand his rise. In Test cricket — the traditional five-day format of the sport — among all players who have scored at least 2 000 runs  Smith has the second-best career average per innings. His 61.37 average is behind only that of Sir Donald Bradman  whose 99.94 average is so far ahead of the competition that  to cricket fans  mere utterance of those four digits evokes his name. Smith’s ascent has been particularly cherished because he seemed to represent traits that Australians like to consider their own. He was largely self-taught. He honed his technique by playing in his back garden  on uneven paving  drawing comparisons to Bradman  who spent hours throwing a golf ball against a water tank  and hitting it with a stump. Another resonant trait is Smith’s sheer resilience and audacity. At the start of his international career  Smith was widely regarded as a joke. When Smith was recalled by Australia midway through the team’s humiliating defeat by England in 2010-11  he shrugged it off  explaining that his role was merely about “having fun and making sure everyone else around is having fun  whether it be telling a joke or something like that.” None None So the revelations about the match in South Africa have left Australia aghast. It has been confirmed that Smith did not intervene despite full knowledge that the team’s vice captain  David Warner  was instructing Cameron Bancroft  the most junior player  to rub sandpaper on the ball  altering its aerodynamics. Warner also received a yearlong suspension  and Bancroft was barred for nine months. “To see the way my old man has been  and my mum  it hurts ” Smith said. “I just want to say I’m sorry for the pain I have brought to Australia and the fans and the public. It’s devastating.” Some have offered sympathy or support for Smith. None Faf du Plessis  South Africa’s captain  who has twice been reprimanded for tampering — he was fined  never suspended — sent Smith a text message to express his sympathies. “I feel for the guy ” du Plessis said  adding that he considered the length of the ban harsh. Others  however  said the punishment would send an appropriate message. None Beyond the specifics  this episode promises to have wider repercussions. In the sport generally  it is inviting a debate about ball tampering — widely believed to be endemic in the sport  albeit more subtly than by Australia’s players last week — and the game’s entire conduct  after myriad recent problems with behavior. None In Australia  the affair is raising questions about the country’s notion of being the land of the “fair go ” and whether the cricket team’s apparent “win at all costs” approach is emblematic of a deeper strand in the country. The Australian foreign minister  Julie Bishop  said that many high commissioners and ambassadors had declared their shock over the incident  and that it had damaged the country’s reputation abroad. “Australia is seen as a country that plays fair  that plays by the rules  abides by the rules ” she said. Smith is unlikely to captain Australia again. But  at only 28 years old  he is widely expected to make an international comeback after his ban. “Cricket is the greatest game in the world ” Smith said. “It’s been my life  and I hope it can be again. Good people make mistakes.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/sports/hockey/givani-smith-police-escort-ohl.html,Police Escort Black Hockey Player to a Playoff Game After Threats Advertisement Supported by None TORONTO — The troubling incident rocketed around the hockey world: Givani Smith  a black player in a top junior league  needed a police escort to a recent playoff game after online threats and racist taunts from fans. Smith  20  a forward with the Kitchener Rangers and a Detroit Red Wings prospect  is one of only about a dozen black players among the roughly 500 players in the Ontario Hockey League  one of three major junior hockey leagues in Canada for players ages 16 to 20 who often go on to N.H.L. careers. For decades  black hockey players at all levels have experienced incidents of racial abuse. “A lot of players of color go through this ” Smith’s agent  G. P. Daniele  lamented. “It’s almost par for the course. It’s unfortunate.” But the level of abuse directed at Smith so concerned the O.H.L. commissioner  David Branch  that he requested the police escort  a move he had not felt obligated to take before. And in the aftermath  some members of the hockey community are calling for more to be done about racial harassment. “I’ve lived in his shoes before ” said Kevin Weekes  43  a black former N.H.L. goaltender and now a lead analyst at NHL Network who played in the O.H.L. in the 1990s. “It’s uncomfortable. It’s confusing.” Smith received threats after he made an obscene gesture toward the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds’ bench after the Rangers’ overtime win in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals on April 29. “There were definitely physical threats ” Rangers General Manager Mike McKenzie said. “I saw some of the stuff that was being sent in  and it was threatening in nature  and you could perceive it as death threats if you wanted to  and obviously the racial stuff as well.” He added that no players or coaches were involved in the abuse. Branch ordered a police escort for Smith for Game 7 in Sault Ste. Marie after consulting with McKenzie and Greyhounds General Manager Kyle Raftis. None McKenzie said Monday that there had been “a few incidents throughout the year” of Smith receiving racist comments. The O.H.L. suspended Smith for two games for the obscene gesture. He had to watch Game 7 on April 30 from the press box. Two police officers met Smith in the lobby of his hotel. They drove him in a squad car to the game  even though it is about a five-minute walk. “We didn’t want him walking to the rink on his own ” McKenzie said. “Once inside the rink  he was in our care in the dressing room area. “There was security with him at all times. It may seem overboard  but there were physical threats. We wanted to make sure he was in a safe environment.” The Rangers lost the game  ending their season and Smith’s junior hockey career. Daniele said Smith  who is from Toronto  did not want to talk publicly about the situation in order to concentrate on his off-ice conditioning. “His goal is to play in the N.H.L. ” he said. Daniele has known his client since Smith was 11. “It’s something he’s had to live with as part of being a black athlete ” said Daniele  who also represents Smith’s brother  Gemel  a Dallas Stars forward. “The Smiths are a quiet  reserved family. They would rather not deal with it and move on.” Daniele released a statement on behalf of Smith’s family  saying: “At this time  Givani respectfully asks for privacy  as he and his family wish to move on from the incident. His focus is now on being a Detroit Red Wing.” Smith was a second-round draft pick by Detroit in 2016. Acquired by Kitchener midway through this season  Smith was a key playoff performer  scoring 11 goals and contributing seven assists in 18 games. “Obviously  it’s disgusting that people do that to another human being ” Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland said. “We support Givani. He’s a tremendous young man. We think he’s a really good prospect for us. He had a tremendous playoff. It’s about what you do on the ice. He’s a committed athlete  and we’re thrilled to have him in our organization. We’ve talked to him since the incident and made sure he understands we’re there to support him.” Shawn Horcoff  the Red Wings’ director of player development  had contacted Smith after his obscene gesture to talk to him about controlling his emotions better on the ice. When Horcoff learned a couple of days later about the threats and the racial slurs that Smith had been subjected to  Horcoff called him again. He said he told Smith he wished he had known more about what he was dealing with. Horcoff said Smith told him: “Listen  I didn’t want to make it a bigger deal than it was. I didn’t want more distractions for my teammates.” Branch said this was the first time since he became commissioner in 1979 that a player needed a police escort to a game. Racial slurs from player to player have occurred in the past  but those incidents are few in number  Branch said  though the league doesn’t keep track. “Have there been indiscretions among players? Yes ” he said. In 2003  John Vanbiesbrouck stepped down as coach and general manager of the Greyhounds after using a racial slur to describe the team captain Trevor Daley  who is black. The next season  the league implemented a diversity program to try to eliminate all forms of harassment and abuse. A player who utters a racial slur against another player can be subject to a minimum five-game suspension. But the O.H.L. does not “legislate fans ” Branch said  also noting that the league and teams cannot control fan behavior on social media. None Weekes said the hockey community needed to “hold people to task” and fans had to hold themselves to account. He would like to see a joint effort by the various leagues and law enforcement to root out racially-charged fan behavior. He also wants longer player suspensions for racial abuse and lifetime bans for fans who make threats to players. McKenzie said the incident involving Smith opened his eyes to what some players have to go through to play hockey. “Hopefully  we don’t have to see this again ” he said  “but I think everyone needs to take a step back and realize it’s a sport and a game and there are people under those helmets and gear and that we need to try to treat each other with a bit more respect and care.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/sports/hockey/olympic-nhl-hockey.html,Without N.H.L.  Olympic Hockey Takes Hit in Ratings and Interest Advertisement Supported by None LOS ANGELES — Only minutes after his team completed an exciting 4-3 win against the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday night  Edmonton Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl already had his hockey gear removed and was standing in front of the television in the visitors’ locker room at Staples Center. Draisaitl  a 22-year-old center  was captivated by a different game: a back-and-forth affair between his native Germany’s Olympic team and its Russian opponent for the gold medal at the Pyeongchang Olympics. “I’m trying to watch it right now ” Draisaitl said  holding off reporters attempting to interview him about the Oilers’ victory  which was decided by a last-second video review that overturned what the Kings believed to be a tying goal. Preoccupied much of the night with Edmonton’s battle against Los Angeles  Draisaitl had to wait until the Oilers’ victory was secured to find out how his countrymen were faring against a heavily-favored Russian team that eventually won  4-3  in overtime. “We had our own game to play ” Draisaitl said  his eyes fixed on the final minutes from South Korea playing out on a nearby television. Draisaitl’s enthusiasm notwithstanding  interest in the Olympic hockey finale appeared to be muted on a busy night of 12 N.H.L. games  10 of which were played in arenas at or near their capacity. In the Kings’ locker room at Staples Center  the German forward Tobias Rieder was not watching the gold medal game after his team’s disappointing loss. A recent trade acquisition from the Arizona Coyotes  Rieder had celebrated Germany’s upset of Canada in the Olympic semifinals by wearing a gold jersey at practice on Friday  along with red tape on his black socks to mimic the German flag. Before the Kings took the ice against the Oilers  he had expressed excitement for the gold medal matchup  even if he wasn’t entirely sure what time the final started. “I thought they played at four in the morning ” he said  inadvertently acknowledging a halfhearted interest shared by some fans. “If I came across it when it was on  I would watch it ” the Kings fan Blaine Yanabu said  adding  “For the most part it wasn’t as exciting because N.H.L. players weren’t there.” Yanabu admitted he was unaware that the Olympic gold medal game was taking place around the same time the Kings were to play the Oilers  or even which two countries were playing for the gold. He was  however  still buzzing about the women’s Olympic ice hockey final on Wednesday  in which the United States captured its first gold medal in the event since 1998 with a shootout victory over archrival Canada. NBC announced that 2.9 million viewers had watched that showdown  making it the most-watched late-night program in the history of NBC Sports Network. The figure was a marked decrease from the 4.9 million viewers who watched the same matchup in the 2014 gold medal game at the 2014 Sochi Games  which was broadcast on NBC — though the 2014 final began at noon Eastern time  while this year’s gold medal game began at 11 p.m. Viewership for this year’s Olympic men’s tournament saw a similar decline. The United States men’s eight-round shootout victory over Russia in the 2014 Sochi Games established a record at the time for a hockey game on NBCSN  with 4.1 million viewers. But a 5-1 United States victory over Slovakia this year drew only a third of that number  a sign that rosters without N.H.L. stars and late-night broadcast times were the most obvious things keeping N.H.L. players and coaches — and others — from tuning in. “I miss having the NHL players there but I don’t know that it needs it ” said David Profumo  a Kings fan who attended Saturday’s game in an Adam Deadmarsh Team U.S.A. jersey. “On the men’s side  it’s more even now  instead of Canada having all their big players out there. I mean  hockey is hockey.” Deprived of an opportunity to watch Germany’s gold medal matchup against Russia from start to finish  Rieder said he hoped he would have a chance to at least discuss the game with Draisaitl before the Oilers left the arena. And maybe chat about what might have been in Pyeongchang. “It’s pretty funny ” Rieder said. “We could be there playing in the finals with Germany  but we’ve got to play against each other.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/sports/hockey/nhl-centennial-goalie-rules.html,When the N.H.L. Began Play 100 Years Ago  Goalies Stood Tall Advertisement Supported by None Hockey looked very different when the N.H.L. played its first games 100 years ago. Arenas were smaller and darker. The players were also smaller  averaging about 5-foot-9 and 160 pounds. Even so  the best of them played close to 60 minutes a game. Small rosters and few substitutions meant the game was slower. Equipment was limited and rather primitive  providing only minimal protection. Players did not hit nearly as hard as they do today. The rules were different too. Forward passing was not yet permitted in the N.H.L.  it would begin to be phased in during the 1918-19 season. When play began with two games on Dec. 19  1917  goalies were not even allowed to drop to the ice to make a save. That night  the Montreal Wanderers beat Toronto  10-9  while the Montreal Canadiens beat the Ottawa Senators  7-4. Joe Malone  who would score 44 goals in just 20 games played in 1917-18  had five goals for the Canadiens. Harry Hyland netted five for the Wanderers  while Reg Noble notched four for Toronto in a losing cause. Three nights later  the Canadiens scored an 11-2 victory over the Wanderers  while Toronto beat Ottawa  11-4. Requiring goalies to remain standing was not the only reason for such high scores  but the rule changed quickly. On Jan. 9  1918  Frank Calder  the president of the N.H.L.  sent the following message to team managers and referees: Section 13 of the rules  and that portion of Section 9 dealing with the goalkeeper  are hereby deleted  thus permitting the goalkeeper to adopt any attitude he pleases in stopping a shot. Please be governed accordingly. While perhaps not the game changer that forward passing became  it is hard to imagine modern hockey without goalies being allowed to leave their feet. Credit for the rule change has often been given to Clint Benedict  a Hall of Fame goalie with the Senators. Benedict’s habit of dropping to his knees to stop the puck had led Toronto fans to mockingly call him Praying Benny. “It was against the rules then ” Benedict told The Ottawa Journal in 1962  “but if you made it look like an accident  you could get away without a penalty. I got pretty good at it.” (Goalies would have wanted to avoid penalties: They served their own penalties until the 1941-42 season  forcing their teammates to guard the net in their absence.) Still  it seems that Art Ross  best known today as the namesake of the N.H.L.’s scoring trophy  was the man behind the rule change. Ross’s lifelong friends Frank and Lester Patrick had changed the goaltending rule in the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association. Ross liked the modification and introduced it for the 1916-17 season in the Art Ross Hockey League  an amateur organization he led in Montreal. Ross had been one of the top players in hockey since the winter of 1905-6. The 1917-18 season would be his last as a player  and a few days before the start of the N.H.L.’s inaugural campaign  he spoke about changing the rules for goalies. Ross  then 32  pointed out that any other player could drop to his knees anywhere on the ice — even if he found himself guarding the net with his goaltender out of position. Three weeks after the start of that first season  the N.H.L. made the switch to allow goalies to drop to the ice. Ross’s Montreal Wanderers had already withdrawn from the league  but newspapers in Montreal and Ottawa noted that he “can enjoy a measure of moral satisfaction from the fact that a suggestion made several weeks ago has been officially adopted by the National Hockey League.” The former Maple Leafs great Johnny Bower  the oldest living N.H.L. netminder at 93  said he was not aware of the old rule. But Toronto’s current goalie  Frederik Andersen  28  had heard of “that funny rule change.” Andersen’s father was his first goalie coach in Denmark  and Andersen said that while he later had an instructor teaching him how to play low to the ice  his coaches generally expected him to stay on his feet. “I think that’s one of those things where you want to be patient ” Andersen said. Patience is hardly the word to describe Bower’s coaches  whether it was Punch Imlach in Toronto or any number of them during his long tenure in the American Hockey League. “If you fell down  the coach would come after you ” said Bower  who played in the 1950s and ’60s. “ ‘Stand up as much as you can ’ they’d say. ‘If you fall down  you’ll be in trouble.’ ” The Hall of Famer Ken Dryden  the Montreal Canadiens’ goaltender in the 1970s  said standing up was the style of play long after Bower  and it was reinforced by coaches and the news media. “Anyone who didn’t was a flopper  and that was a disparaging term ” he said. Dryden said it was not until after he stopped playing that he realized the standup style was simply a compromise for safety. It was not until the 1960s that many goalies started wearing masks. “You protect your head ” he said. “Keep it out of the way  above the bar. It didn’t have anything to do with effectiveness. Even after the mask  standup was still the style.” But playing standup did not necessarily mean playing upright. Of the goalies he watched growing up in the 1950s  Dryden said: “Terry Sawchuk crouched  but he didn’t go down much. Jacques Plante played on his skates. He was very fluid  and in a deep crouch  but it was still a standup style.” Dryden loved the way Glenn Hall moved around his crease. Hall is considered the pioneer of the butterfly style  spreading his legs wide across the ice to cover the bottom of the net. “They often called me a flopper ” said Hall  who was known as Mr. Goalie. “I’d get upset with that. I was the opposite of a flopper. I was under control.” Before Hall  and for a long time after  when goalies went down  they often flung themselves to one side of the net or the other  stacking their pads to provide the largest barrier. “I found that you could spread your legs wide and cover more of the dangerous part of the net ” Hall said. “If you stacked your pads  it took you all weekend to get up. With the butterfly  all you needed was to catch an edge with a skate blade  and with a slight rocking motion  you were back up and in position.” It was not until the 1980s  with François Allaire as the first modern goalie coach and Patrick Roy as his star pupil  that the butterfly style became the norm. Modern innovations also lightened and strengthened goalie equipment. And then came Dominik Hasek  who  Dryden said  “understood that he could bring his whole body under the bar.” “It was all about finding as much of your body as possible to put between the puck and the net ” he added. “Stand up  lie down. It’s no longer a compromise between performance and safety. You’re perfectly protected now. It’s all about performance.” Eric Zweig has written 40 books about hockey and history  including “Art Ross: The Hockey Legend Who Built the Bruins” and “The Toronto Maple Leafs: The Complete Oral History.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports

Titles Advertisement Supported by None It is difficult for the men and women who play hockey at Clarkson University to steer clear of each other — not that they would want to. The two teams play at the same 3 000-seat arena  at a school with an enrollment of 3 268 in Potsdam  N.Y.  a town of about 17 000. The men’s and women’s players often sit with one other in classes. They tend to socialize  and sometimes even go out on dates. Hockey tends to be a common topic of conversation  of course  and they usually attend the other team’s games when their schedules allow. This season  Clarkson was among three universities to have both their men’s and women’s Division I hockey teams qualify for the N.C.A.A. tournament  joining Ohio State (enrollment: 52 517) and Northeastern (17 506). None Now it is the men’s turn. The Golden Knights (23-10-6)  seeded third in the East Region  face No. 2 seed Providence (23-11-4) on Friday in Bridgeport  Conn.  with the winner advancing to play Notre Dame or Michigan Tech for a berth in the Frozen Four in St. Paul. Clarkson has had a men’s hockey program since 1921  but the men are making their first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance in 10 years. The women’s hockey program started in 2003 and made its first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance in 2010  winning a national championship four years later. “Academics come first here  but hockey is the one time where we can play the Notre Dames and Minnesotas of the world ” said Steve Yianoukos  the director of athletics and recreation at Clarkson. “But when we popped out in women’s hockey  they didn’t have a clue who we were.” Now they do. Hockey is the only sport in which Clarkson competes at the Division I level  its other programs are Division III. The school  which sits only 30 miles from the Canadian border  is a true hockey hotbed. “It’s one of our selling points — we’re a great hockey school ” said Matt Desrosiers  who finished his 10th season as the women’s coach. When asked if the women might have inspired the men with their recent success  Savannah Harmon  who was a captain and played defense for the women’s team  laughed. “I don’t know that I’d go that far with it ” she said. But the hockey atmosphere is contagious  she said  and the teams tend to feed off each other’s successes without being competitive about it. “We all get along really well ” she said. “I know that me and my friends from the men’s teams will all sit together in class  and we’ll all talk about our games. The coaches’ rooms are on each side of a hall  so we see each other all the time.” They share notes. Before Clarkson played in the Women’s Frozen Four in Minneapolis last week  Desrosiers said  he asked a men’s assistant  Josh Hauge  to study some video of opponents to help him with a tactic. “Everybody is really supportive  the coaching staffs go to each other’s games ” Desrosiers said. “We get feedback from them. We’ve got to coordinate ice times and practice times and go to different events together. It’s very much a collaborative effort.” The Clarkson men’s program has made 20 appearances in the N.C.A.A. tournament  including nine berths in the 1990s  but has not been there since 2008. When Casey Jones took over as the men’s coach in 2011  the Golden Knights were in the middle of a run of five consecutive losing seasons. “We just needed to get the right type of players ” said Jones  who was formerly an associate coach at Cornell. “We feel like this is a culmination.” The Clarkson men posted winning seasons in each of the last two years. The Golden Knights have been nationally ranked this season  twice beating Providence  their opponent on Friday. They lost to Princeton in the ECAC championship game at Lake Placid  N.Y.  but earned an at-large berth into the N.C.A.A. tournament. “The relationships we have on this team have been really strong — it’s an outstanding locker room ” said Nic Pierog  a junior forward. “It’s like we’ve taken it a step farther this year.” Jones would rather steer clear of comparisons to the women’s program  saying: “From our perspective  we’re different animals. It’s a real dog-eat-dog world in this sport  but I think we’re a viewed as a program as where we need to be.” He added  “I actually think we’re both successful because of the impact the university has had on the program.” It is spring break on the Clarkson campus  and some of the players on the women’s team have scattered. But Harmon said she planned to drive with her friends to Bridgeport to watch the men’s team  and Desrosiers said he would have a “viewing party” at his house. Pierog said the men’s team was happy for the women’s team  “but  coming into the season  we had our own goals and what we wanted to accomplish.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/21/sports/hockey/jim-johannson-olympics.html,Jim Johannson  General Manager of U.S. Men’s Hockey Team  Dies at 53 Advertisement Supported by None COLORADO SPRINGS  Colo. — Jim Johannson  a longtime USA Hockey executive and U.S. Olympic men’s hockey general manager  died unexpectedly Sunday at age 53  shocking the sport less than three weeks before the start of the Pyeongchang Games. Johannson died away in his sleep at his home in Colorado Springs  according to USA Hockey. His death came in the midst of the most high-profile role in his career: putting together the American Olympic men’s hockey team without N.H.L. players going to South Korea  a position he relished after doing so at several world junior and world championships. “He had a couple of the greatest days of his life at USA Hockey recently to be able to call all these guys that never thought in their lives they’d play on a U.S. Olympic hockey team  and he got to tell them that they realized a dream ” said Pat Kelleher  the executive director of USA Hockey. “I think that meant as much to Jimmy as it did to any of the players.” With the N.H.L. out of the Olympics for the first time since 1994  Johannson was excited about putting together a 25-man roster that would include “25 great stories.” He picked Tony Granato as coach and on Jan. 1 unveiled a diverse roster made up of players from European professional leagues  the American Hockey League and the N.C.A.A. Johannson was proud of the unheralded roster  one that will now try to capture a gold medal for him. “I think it would be huge ” the former USA Hockey executive director Dave Ogrean said. “If we ever had a ‘Win one for the Gipper’ moment  this is it.” It’s unclear who would be in charge of choosing any potential injury replacements if needed. The United States opens the Olympics Feb. 14 against Slovenia. The talent pool now and in other tournaments is deeper in part because of Johannson  who has overseen the growth of hockey in the United States beyond the “Miracle On Ice” in 1980. The retired American forward Jeremy Roenick said  “USA hockey is a world power now because of people like Jimmy Johannson.” The United States. won 64 medals  including 34 gold  in major international competition during Johannson’s tenure. The Americans in particular became a perennial threat to win the world junior championship  showing the program’s improvement at the youth levels. Carolina Hurricanes president Don Waddell said Johannson “has been a driving force in making both the USA Hockey men’s and women’s programs into consistent winners.” and Phil Housley  who coached the 2015 junior team to a gold medal  said Johannson “grew our game to new heights.” “In building the teams that achieved so much success for USA Hockey  Jim Johannson had a sharp eye for talent  a strong sense of chemistry and a relentless pursuit of excellence ” N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman said. “As we mourn his loss  we will remember the positive outlook Jim brought to his tireless efforts to advance USA Hockey.” Johannson  who played for the U.S. at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics  began working for USA Hockey in 2000 after spending five years as the general manager of the Twin Cities Vulcans in the United States Hockey League. He was promoted to assistant executive director of hockey operations in 2007  overseeing the organization’s efforts in fielding teams for international competition. He played college hockey at Wisconsin and helped the Badgers win the N.C.A.A. championship as a freshman. He was selected by the Hartford Whalers in the seventh round of the 1982 draft  and although he never played in the N.H.L.  he was respected and well-liked by those all over hockey. “We lost a true friend in Jim Johannson today ” said Granato  who played with Johannson on the 1988 Olympic team. “He was so compassionate and as loyal a friend as you could have. He was the ultimate teammate. I am deeply saddened and shocked and sorry that he is no longer with us. He was a special human being. Please pray for Jim’s wife and daughter  Abby and Ellie.” Kelleher said USA Hockey would think about ways to pay tribute to Johannson at the Pyeongchang Games after grieving this loss. “Today it’s really just trying to help his family as best as we can and really just try and honestly put one foot in front of the other ” Kelleher said. “We’ll have to see what we can do to try and honor him in some fashion.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/26/opinion/olympic-games-hockey.html,A Minor Miracle on Ice at the Olympic Games? Advertisement Supported by Sporting None I make my living as a hockey writer. I’m also as big a fan of the sport as there is  and I love Olympic hockey. But now that N.H.L. players won’t represent their countries in the Pyeongchang Games  will I even watch? For hockey fans  the N.H.L.’s decision to send its players to the Winter Olympics beginning in 1998 was a dream come true. There had been major international tournaments  but never with these sorts of stakes on this big a stage. Finally  fans would get a true best-on-best Olympic tournament played in front of a worldwide audience  with dream rosters and genuine suspense over who would win the gold. None When the N.H.L. said it would not send players to the 2018 Games  many of us assumed it was a bluff. Surely some sort of last-minute deal would be found? But it wasn’t a bluff. Fans were furious  players were furious. After the anger  the question: Is it worth watching? None On the other hand  once you’ve had the best  going back to something else feels underwhelming. It’s tempting to write the whole thing off. But I don’t think I will. This year’s tournament won’t feature the best  but there are plenty of fascinating stories to follow. Few of them ever expected to have an Olympic opportunity  and for most  this will be their one and only shot. None None That’s not Auston Matthews or Patrick Kane. But maybe it doesn’t have to be. Team Canada fans hoping to see Sidney Crosby or Connor McDavid will have to settle for names like former N.H.L.ers Derek Roy and Mason Raymond. Or they can root for the defenseman Chay Genoway: An undrafted long shot  he dreamed of making the N.H.L.  and he did — for just a single game  in 2012. That’s one better than Mat Robinson  who never made it at all  and neither did the team’s oldest player  37-year-old Chris Lee. Then there’s goaltender Ben Scrivens  an undrafted Cornell graduate who spent almost his entire five-year N.H.L. career playing in three of Canada’s most high-pressure markets — Toronto  Edmonton and Montreal. He built a devoted fan base through a thoughtful social media presence  and his wife  Jenny  was a goaltender for the New York Riveters of the National Women’s Hockey League. Unlike the members of previous Team Canada rosters  these guys don’t have N.H.L. playoff races to return to when it’s over. Instead  they’ll be playing in easily the most important games of their careers. In a way  that feels like what the Olympics should be. None And if you really can’t get excited about Olympic hockey without the presence of genuine N.H.L. star power  there’s always Team Sweden. Their roster will feature the teenage phenom Rasmus Dahlin  a ridiculously skilled defenseman expected to go first overall in the next N.H.L. draft. At 17 years old  he’ll be the fifth youngest player to ever appear in the men’s Olympic tournament. There’s no point pretending that any of it will feel like Matthews vs. McDavid  or Crosby bearing down on Henrik Lundqvist with a gold medal on the line. But the N.H.L.’s decision to pack up its pucks and go home has left both a void and an opportunity. The players looking to fill it aren’t the best in the world or even all that close  many of them will make less over the course of their careers than Crosby or Kane take home in a month. It won’t be the same  and we know that. But it might be two weeks of triumph and heartbreak and yes  maybe even a minor miracle or two. That should be enough. I’ll be watching to find out.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/arts/music/soccer-mommy-clean-review.html,Soccer Mommy Confronts All the Disappointments of Love on ‘Clean’ Advertisement Supported by Album Review None Love is no paradise in the songs of Sophie Allison  20  who records as Soccer Mommy. It’s a realm of misunderstandings  disappointments  unfulfilled longings and everyday betrayals  and Soccer Mommy’s songs recount them in a haze of acceptance and resentment. “In the summer you said you loved me like an animal/Stayed beside me just enough to keep your belly full ” Ms. Allison sings in “So Clean”  then she devotes the remaining verses to missing him  predatory as he is  through the fall  winter and spring. None None But she soon gathered additional instruments and confidence  turning Soccer Mommy into an indie-rock band and getting signed to Fat Possum. She reworked six Bandcamp songs and added two newer  more assertive ones for “Collection ” released last year. “Clean” — with nine songs and an instrumental interlude — is billed as Soccer Mommy’s debut album  Ms. Allison’s first to be conceived as a whole and recorded in a studio with backup musicians and a producer. It takes pains not to be at all slick. Ms. Allison’s voice often droops a little flat  instruments are hand-played rather than programmed and the mix is proudly smudgy. As if to insist that Soccer Mommy is still loyal to low-fi  a few songs flaunt deliberate studio glitches. A demo take is suddenly spliced into “Still Clean ” while in “Cool ” the sound of a tape slowing down derails the big rock buildup at the end. But even as it clings to indie modesty  “Clean” greatly expands the scope of Ms. Allison’s songs in both words and music. She’s not just sweet  sad and lovelorn any more. She’s riled enough  amid the tangle of guitar lines in “Your Dog ” to announce: “I want a love that lets me breathe/And I’ve been choking on your leash.” And she’s blunt and skeptical enough to face her insecurities about whether she could possibly live up to her boyfriend’s ex in “Last Girl ” with a chorus that asks  even as it echoes the beat of 1960s girl groups  “Why would you still want to be with me? She’s got everything.” Infidelity also looms  in “Flaw” and “Scorpio Rising.” She’s wildly attracted to the guy in “Scorpio Rising ” but she also clearly sees him eyeballing someone who’s “bubbly and sweet like a Coca-Cola.” In “Flaw ” she’s the one who strays  but  she sings  “I choose  choose to blame it all on you/’cause I don’t like the truth.” On Soccer Mommy’s previous band-style recordings  songs tended to stick to one sound from start to finish: a watery guitar strum  a certain band beat. But “Clean” is full of changes  newly willing to use contrast and dynamics. “Blossom (Wasting All My Time) ” a song about “wondering if you really love me” and finding someone better  starts and ends with a strummed guitar  but opens out depths of bass and reverberation along the way. “Skin ” a song about deep physical yearning — “I’m clawing at your skin trying to see your bones” — juxtaposes a stolid drumbeat with an octave-leaping vocal line and multiple tiers of guitars and glockenspiel  striving to incarnate the craving in sound. But she also matter-of-factly adds  “I wish you also felt like this.” Both cleareyed and passionate  she is growing up in public  unabashed.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/sports/soccer/soccer-memory-west-brom.html,Seeking Solace  and Finding Strength  in Shared Soccer Memories Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None WEST BROMWICH  England — Steve Griffiths first noticed something was wrong about four years ago. The clues were only little things — putting something down and not being able to remember where  forgetting longstanding appointments — but they were enough to make him worry. At first  he and his wife  Heather  wondered if it might be stress. Griffiths ran his own tire business  and that meant long days at work and hours at night worrying about the competition. They thought giving up work might improve his health  so Steve took early retirement. It made no difference. For a while  then  they wondered if perhaps he was experiencing the early stages of Parkinson’s disease. His hands shook a little when he talked  his movement was slightly stiff. Last July  though  he learned it was not Parkinson’s. Instead  Steve  60 at the time  was told he had early-onset Alzheimer’s. There was a little relief in finally having a diagnosis  in “knowing what we were facing ” as Heather said  but mostly it was shock and fear. “It took awhile to come to terms with it ” she said. A few months on  Steve has “good days and bad days  times when I am a bit depressed  a bit down.” Losing his driver’s license  and the independence it bestowed  hit him hard. Mainly  though  it is the little things that hurt  dozens of them every day. Each one is another little blow delivered by his disease. Each one erodes his confidence a little more  eating away at his sense of self. Beneath the fog  though  Steve is who he has always been. The big things  including that composite of experience and memory and interests that defines a person  are still there. He has been a West Bromwich Albion fan since he was a child  and neither his condition nor the team’s recent struggles have changed that. He gave up his season ticket a few years ago  coping with the match day crowds at the Hawthorns was too much. But he still goes to the stadium  only now it is when the stands are quiet and the field is empty. Along with Heather  Steve has come every Wednesday for the last six weeks as part of a program  run for five years by West Brom’s foundation  called Albion Memories. Each group consists of a handful of West Brom fans  all of them suffering from some form of dementia  as well as some partners and caregivers. One or two wear West Brom scarves  gently draping them over their chairs  or knitted hats embroidered with the club’s crest. They come to meet and to talk — “to get out of the house ” as Heather put it. But mainly  they come to remember. “We want to energize their memories  to get them talking again ” said Paul Glover  the foundation’s head of disability. The best way to do that  he believes  is through soccer  through West Brom  tapping into the vast reservoir of memories built up through a lifetime of being a fan  its hold so strong that it remains untouched even as dementia starts to take a toll in other ways. “Their memory is often very good  even if they cannot recall what they had for dinner last night ” said Jan Liddell  a senior health care support worker at Edward Street mental health hospital. All of the members of the group are patients at Edward Street  all have expressed an interest in soccer  and all  as part of their treatment  have been offered the chance to join the Albion Memories program. “With memory  there is an element of use it or lose it ” Liddell said. They come here to use it. The format is simple. The participants sit in a semicircle in a stadium lounge  gazing through a picture window at the field — the view itself is an aide-mémoire  Liddell said — while John Homer  the head of West Brom’s supporters’ club and a walking encyclopedia of the Black Country  as this part of England is known  interviews a player. Some interview subjects are drawn from the current squad  though Glover says the former stars get the best reactions: not just because of West Brom’s current struggles  but because those are the names and the faces that the aging members of the group — Griffiths  now 61  is among the youngest — remember. A few weeks ago  the guests were Graham Lovett and Graham Williams  veterans of the West Brom team that won the 1968 F.A. Cup  and the club’s former striker Micky Fudge. All three  at Homer’s gentle insistence  cycled through their memories of their playing days  telling stories  cracking jokes  amiably mocking one another. When Lovett lost the thread on one anecdote  Williams suggested with a smile that perhaps he should be in the audience  not on the stage. Skillfully  Homer seizes on every little story to spark something in the group. He asks where the players used to drink  and asks those listening if they remember the pub  if they know where it is. He mentions cafes and ice cream parlors  some long since closed  and cars that have not been on the road for decades. None “The key is to go into their world  not drag them into yours ” Homer said. He brings along old newspaper clippings and weathered programs as prompts  each one passed around  and pored over  by the group. Some visitors join in more readily than others  but whenever Homer — or any of his guests — brings up a player  even a name long forgotten  the reaction is universal. As Lovett tells a story about playing against Johnny Haynes  a revered 1950s star for Fulham  there is a ripple of recognition  a murmur of approval. These sessions do not cure dementia. They cannot. Nonetheless  their effect can be profound. Some of that comes from the simple act of socializing  organizers said  since many of those living with dementia find themselves increasingly isolated. “The clinical impact of loneliness is massive ” said Tony Jameson Allen  co-founder of the Sporting Memories Foundation  an organization that uses similar reminiscence therapies to run more than 100 such programs in Britain. “People with dementia often see their social circles reduce significantly. Groups like these can be really powerful.” Increasingly  soccer is being used as their focal point. A number of teams — including Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers  West Brom’s fierce local rival — run similar programs  and the National Football Museum in Manchester opens its doors for patients suffering with dementia  too. Liddell said that she has seen how effective it can be firsthand. “When they come here  they all talk and interact  and they see that they are not alone ” she said. “There is a definite benefit for their well-being.” Most of all  though  the pleasure and the purpose are in the acts of remembering  of being able to remember  of feeling like themselves again. “This disease strikes at the heart of identity ” said Jason Karlawish  a co-director of the Penn Memory Center at the University of Pennsylvania. “It can lead to a fractured sense of who you are. The logic of an activity like this is to kindle emotionally salient memories that tap back into that identity.” He noted that while there was no data proving such therapies had a curative effect  much the same could be said of medication. “These are substantive programs ” he said. Over the years  Glover has seen hundreds of people like Griffiths attend the sessions  but the experiences of one or two have stayed with him. “We had one woman who came to the group with her father ” he said. Under Homer’s guidance  the man started to talk about the games he had seen  the players he had watched  the highs and lows. He was no longer someone with dementia. He was what he always had been  what he still was: a West Brom fan. The visit was just as powerful for his daughter. “She said that when he was here  she did not see him as she knew him ” Glover said  but as something  someone else. “She said she saw him as his younger self.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/21/sports/soccer/tottenham-hotspur-mauricio-pochettino.html,Pochettino Has Mastered the Process. A Prize  Any Prize  Still Eludes Him. Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None LONDON — As the minutes ticked by and the goal did not arrive  Mauricio Pochettino fidgeted and fretted on the touchline. He crouched down on his haunches. He ran his fingers through his hair. He paced back and forth to his coaching staff  airing his exasperation at his players  the referee  the universe. When the whistle blew on Saturday  and Tottenham Hotspur’s 2-1 defeat to Manchester United in the F.A. Cup semifinals was confirmed  he was — by his own estimation — “disappointed  frustrated.” He did not look much like a man who considered the F.A. Cup a distraction  a sideline  an irrelevance. He looked  instead  like a man who cared. That is not the impression he has always given  of course. It would be unfair to say Pochettino  throughout his four years as Spurs’ head coach  has belittled England’s two domestic cups  but he has certainly made clear they are not his priority. He has earned a reputation for naming weakened teams for cup games. He has spoken frequently of how the momentary elation of winning a trophy is a distant second to a place in the Premier League’s top four. Indeed  only a couple of days before this semifinal  he suggested that winning the F.A. Cup — what would have been Spurs’ first trophy in 10 years — would “not change our lives.” This defeat — Spurs’ eighth consecutive F.A. Cup semifinal loss — seemed to prompt something of a change of heart. Pochettino’s Spurs lost at the same stage of the same competition last year. The team missed out on the League Cup in 2015  beaten by Chelsea in the final. And  of course  there were the two seasons in which Spurs provided the most consistent challenge for the Premier League title  2016 and 2017  only to be beaten to the line first by Leicester City and then by Chelsea. “We are close  we are close  we are close ” Pochettino said. “Nearly close enough to touch.” Every time  though  his team has fallen short. And now  he said  he knows that painstaking  hard-won progress in the league  and improving performances in the Champions League  are no longer “enough.” “The only way to reach this last level  not just to compete  but to win” is to break that seal  to pick up that first trophy  he said. The view that Spurs needs something tangible not just to prove its progress under Pochettino but to cement it has become something close to received wisdom. Inside the club  players admit — as both Jan Vertonghen and Harry Kane have said — it is time to “win something.” That belief is  if anything  even stronger on the outside. Alan Shearer  the former England striker  wrote earlier this season that Spurs could not pass up the chance to open its new stadium later this year “with a trophy held aloft.” Only then can Spurs claim a place among the game’s true elite. Until then  it is merely a pretender. Pochettino  finally  has joined the chorus. And yet it is worth remembering exactly where Tottenham was  what it was  when he first arrived at the club  four years ago. The last game before Pochettino arrived was in May 2014  a meaningless  meandering home win against Aston Villa. Spurs was sixth at the start of that day  sandwiched between Everton and Manchester United  with European qualification secured but a place in the Champions League impossibly distant. In Pochettino’s place on the bench at White Hart Lane was his predecessor  Tim Sherwood. For most of the game  at least. Midway through the second half  with his team up  3-0  Sherwood decided it was time  in his words  for “some banter.” Not far from the dugout sat a couple of fans who had  Sherwood said  been “telling me what to do every week.” Turning away from the field  Sherwood suddenly pointed to one of them  Danny Grimsdale. Sherwood asked Grimsdale if he wanted to put his money where his mouth was  to come and sit on the bench and see if he could do Sherwood’s job as well as he thought. Grimsdale demurred at first but soon changed his mind. He trotted over the advertising boards  skipped up to Sherwood  slipped on the manager’s vest — an item of clothing that had become something of a trademark — and duly took his place on the bench. Sherwood laughed. Grimsdale laughed. White Hart Lane laughed. None None It was a team that appointed Sherwood as coach  despite deep-seated reservations  and then watched as he went rogue  criticizing his players  his board  and eventually offering his place on the bench to a fan. It was a team that churned through managers and players with little rhyme or reason  a club forever in flux. Pochettino has changed all of that. His transformation of Tottenham is  when examined not in the heat of a moment and the bitterness of defeat but at one remove  one of the most remarkable achievements in recent English soccer history. Spurs did not used to reach two semifinals — and one league cup final — in the space of three years. It did not used to beat Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. It did not even used to qualify  with the exception of the occasional season under Harry Redknapp  for the Champions League. It did not used to mount title challenges of any sort  successful or not. It did not used to provide the backbone of the England team  or be seen as a paragon of virtue when it came to youth development. Real Madrid and Paris St.-Germain did not used to look toward its manager with envious eyes  they did not used to talk glowingly of Tim Sherwood in the marble halls of the Bernabéu. Pochettino’s detractors would point out that none of those are the ultimate aim for a manager  for a team: José Mourinho  Pochettino’s longtime friend and temporary tormentor at Wembley on Saturday  would have no truck with the idea that managerial achievement can be weighed in any other way than silver and gold. But they are all concrete achievements. Pochettino has fundamentally changed Tottenham’s identity. He has revolutionized how the club is seen  its place in the firmament. And that  by his own estimation  is what he was employed to do. A few years ago  during his first full season in England  at Southampton  Pochettino was asked whether it is a manager’s aim to win trophies  or to leave some sort of enduring impact on a club  on the sport. “It is better to leave your mark  without doubt ” he said. “That is my personal value.” He has done that  beyond any reasonable doubt. He has turned Tottenham into a bastion of stability  of progress  of promise. He is right to talk of how “the process is more important than winning a trophy.” What he has done is a greater triumph — and a bigger test of his abilities — than winning the League Cup  or perhaps even its older brother  the F.A. Cup. Tottenham has not yet shaken off its tag as a perennial loser  the team whose history — as Giorgio Chiellini put it — is “always to be missing something to arrive at the end.” But there is another way of looking at that: Pochettino has put the club in a position to fail at the last again. It is not so long ago that it failed a long way before that. It is easy to forget just how far Tottenham has come under his guidance  but it is worth remembering. In four years  he has changed where Spurs is  and what it is. Pochettino has made the laughter stop. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/sports/soccer/liverpool-legends-bayern-masters-football.html,The Players Are Retired. But Try Telling Them the Games Don’t Matter. Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None LIVERPOOL  England — As soon as he hit the pass  Xabi Alonso stopped dead in his tracks  and raised his hands to his head in horror. He had picked up possession on the edge of Liverpool’s penalty area  directly in front of the Kop. He was under no pressure. He turned elegantly toward his goal  ready to build yet another attack. He has done it thousands of times over the years  and this time  too  he looked a picture of calm — right up until he played the ball directly into the path of a slightly startled opposition striker. Liverpool  a few minutes before  had been three goals ahead. Now  thanks to Alonso’s momentary mindlessness  it was 4-3 down. Alonso looked at the floor. He raised a plaintive hand to his teammates and to Anfield  packed to the rafters  in apology  he shook his head  as if to clear the cobwebs. And then the crowd laughed. The mistake did not matter  and nor did the score. It was  after all  only a game between a team of retired Liverpool players against a collection of Bayern Munich veterans  staged to raise money for Liverpool’s charitable foundation. Beyond a little pride  there was nothing riding on it. So nobody objected when Alexander Zickler  the beneficiary of Alonso’s generosity  raced over to thank him  with pantomime ostentation  for the assist. Everyone got the joke: Alonso would be switching teams at halftime anyway  a veteran of both Liverpool and Bayern  he had  briefly  forgotten whose side he was on. There can be a strange air to soccer played not for points or for trophies  but for its own sake. Think flat  rootless preseason tuneups  or international friendlies  where mindless waves sweep through indifferent crowds. Few fans enjoy those occasions: To most  they are something to be endured before the real business — soccer for a purpose — can start again. They feel somehow decaffeinated  fat-free: diet sport. Games between teams of alumni and veterans — masters or legends teams  as the marketing always has it — should  if anything  be worse  even more meaningless  even more devoid of tension. And yet  that afternoon late in March  Anfield was almost full. Nearly 55 000 people were there when  with a few minutes to go  the former Liverpool defender Bjorn Tore Kvarme scored the game’s final goal. It finished 5-5. There is  it seems  a considerable  widespread appetite for seeing former players back in a team’s colors. Masters tournaments are nothing new — in England  an annual Masters Football competition ran until sparse attendances and dwindling television interest forced its cancellation in 2011 — but never before have they been such a boom industry. None Masters Football may no longer hold games in England  but it stages regular meetings of teams representing Liverpool and Arsenal in Singapore. Football Champions Tour has been arranging showpiece games for 10 years and  last year  together with the marketing agency Pitch International  launched Star Sixes in London. It intends to turn the format into an annual event and  though attendance in London was good  according to F.C.T.’s director  Jamie Jarvis  the competition’s next iteration most likely will be in Asia. “A lot of the interest is from markets that did not see these players day in  day out during their careers ” Jarvis said. “But London is a difficult market. We have had interest from Qatar  the United Arab Emirates  China  South Africa  Tokyo  Sydney.” F.C.T. tends to recruit high-profile former stars — Star Sixes featured the likes of Luis Figo  Roberto Carlos and Carles Puyol — to play six-a-side games  on the grounds that full-scale matches on full-size pitches can be a “hard slog” not only for the older players  but for the fans. That is part of the appeal  of course: the chance to see recently retired heroes in action  something that fans in the Far East were not able to do during their careers. But the opportunity to get close to them is another draw: retired players are “far more accessible” than their successors  Jarvis said. It is an approach that AOK Traditionsmasters has used since its inception eight years ago  pitting teams representing various German and international clubs against each other over the course of six hours in the Max-Schmeling-Halle in Berlin. “Our visitors can get autographs and selfies with the players ” said the event’s founder  Bernd Kühn. “As well as six hours of great soccer  for a much cheaper price than you pay to go to a Bundesliga game.” Most important of all in his eyes  though  is the shot of nostalgia the occasion provides. “It is a chance to see the old guys ” he said. “You can dream of the old days  and show your kids the players you loved.” The fact that there are always “one or two players who are heavier than the audience” does not hurt  either. Kühn’s tournament will be 10 years old next year  when for the first time he plans to hold it over two days. Ideally  he said  he would like to hold qualifying events across Germany  turning the Berlin showpiece — at the height of the Bundesliga’s winter break — into a national finals. He feels there is enough appetite among fans. If anything  though  the players are even more enthusiastic. Like many former players  Viv Anderson  once of Manchester United and England  compares retirement to suffering “a bereavement.” It is the loss of the only life many players have ever known  few are prepared for what happens away from the cocoon of a professional club  and the sanctuary and spirit of a locker room. “Every week that goes by  the phone rings a little less often  you feel that bit more isolated ” Anderson said. “But the club has moved on. The agent has moved on to the next shiny star. For the first two weeks  maybe  you enjoy it. By the third week  you’re asking  ‘What am I going to do now?’” Many struggle to find the answer. Research by FIFpro  the global players’ union  has suggested that as many as 35 percent of former players have depression and anxiety. Xpro  a charity set up to help with the welfare of former players  found that 40 percent are declared bankrupt within five years of retirement  while 33 percent are divorced within 12 months. It is here  Anderson said  that veterans games can help. He is now the chief executive of PlayOnPro  an organization that aims to keep former athletes from a variety of sports in touch with one another  and with various work opportunities. PlayOnPro has launched an app  accessible only to members  to help players reconnect with old friends  as well as to find out about after-dinner speaking engagements  golf outings and playing opportunities. Last year  the group sent a team to a seven-a-side tournament in Hong Kong. “They might have money in the bank ” Anderson said  “but we try to give them somewhere to go  something to get up for. Players don’t miss winning trophies when they retire. They miss the camaraderie of the dressing room. “You do not earn a fortune for playing in these games: maybe a bit of spending money for while you are there. But it means you can speak to people you have not spoken to for years  and to live the same life you had 20 years ago  even if it’s just for a few days. It is something to look forward to.” Players  even in their relative dotage  love playing  he has noticed. Games that are meant to be exhibitions quickly turn serious  so serious that Kühn  at least  has considered banning tackling in his competition. “The competitive juices flow pretty quickly ” Jarvis said. No matter where the game is  no matter who they are representing  no matter how old they are  “players want to come and win.” About an hour into the game at Anfield  Hans Pflügler replaced Lothar Matthäus in Bayern’s team. Pflügler is 58 now: He first left Bayern in 1992  having spent his entire career at the club  before returning in 1995. He retired  finally  in 2002  at age 42. By the time he came on against Liverpool  the pace had slowed considerably. John Aldridge  a former Liverpool striker  had made a brief cameo  twice losing his footing as he tried to run  his pratfalls greeted by uproarious laughter. Pflügler  though  was in no mood for silliness. He thundered into tackles and protested when he conceded a free kick. He heaved the ball into the crowd as Liverpool pushed for an equalizer  complained to the referee about his decisions  rallied his teammates to hold on to their lead. There was nothing at stake  but Pflügler wanted to win. Sometimes  even games that do not matter have a meaning. None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/02/sports/soccer/liverpool-roma-champions-league.html,Champions League: Liverpool Ousts Roma in Loss That Doubles as a Triumph Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None ROME — Slowly  reluctantly  their voices hoarse and their shoulders slumped  A.S. Roma’s fans started to lift themselves from their seats and head toward the Stadio Olimpico exits  ready to make the long  sorrowful journey back into town. Only a minute remained of the second leg of this Champions League semifinal  sixty more seconds after three frantic  chaotic  lunatic hours of soccer over two games. Liverpool still  somehow  led by 7-5 on aggregate. Roma needed to score twice more simply to force extra time. At last  Roma’s fans resigned themselves to the inevitable. It was over. It would be Liverpool in the Champions League final for the first time in 11 years  against Real Madrid in Kiev  Ukraine  on May 26. Roma’s time had run out. Then Cengiz Under  a Roma substitute still fizzing with energy  burst into Liverpool’s box once more. The ball careered into the hand of Liverpool defender Ragnar Klavan. Damir Skomina  the referee  awarded a penalty. The drift stopped  and watched. Radja Nainggolan scored. There was a glimmer: One goal would do it now. On the field  Roma’s players pleaded with Skomina to add on more time  not to cut them short. In the stands  they roared. That moment  more than any other  summed up a semifinal that veered between mesmerizing and madcap  that even Jürgen Klopp  Liverpool’s manager  called “crazy.” This was a semifinal  after all  that was over after little more than an hour of the first leg: when Liverpool was flying  5-0 up  sweeping into the final  an unstoppable force. And yet  somehow  it was also a contest that  with just a few seconds remaining before Skomina finally blew his whistle and confirmed Liverpool’s return to the grandest game in club soccer  hung entirely in the balance. None None But more pressingly  it says something about Liverpool  too  about its addiction to drama  its compulsion to live life on the edge  its determination to crest and fall with the waves of its own emotion: the strengths that make it such a force at its best and the weaknesses that make it so vulnerable when it is not. This is a team that can win 5-2 and feel like it has been beaten  and a team that can lose 4-2 and feel like it has triumphed  all in the space of eight days. For all the relief in Klopp and his players at the final whistle  though  the scale of what Liverpool has achieved this season should not be underestimated. True  it rode its luck here  granting Roma a raft of chances  relying on some flustered finishing and some generous refereeing — Roma should have had “two penalties ” said its president  James Pallotta  Monchi  its sporting director  pointed out that the final  if video refereeing was available in the Champions League  would be Roma against Bayern Munich. True  Liverpool’s run to Kiev has been slightly kinder than Real’s: The reigning champion has taken on Paris Saint-Germain  Juventus and Bayern Munich  the champions of France  Italy and Germany  while Liverpool has faced F.C. Porto and Roma. Only Manchester City  of the teams Liverpool has overcome  would be regarded as part of Europe’s top rank. And  true  it has won nothing yet. As Klopp pointed out afterward  he has already reached two finals with Liverpool: the League Cup and the Europa League in his first  partial season in 2016. He lost them both. “Nobody has thanked me for taking Liverpool to those finals ” he said. “They do not hang silver medals at Melwood ” Liverpool’s training facility. But simply breathing the same air as Real  that relentless winner of this competition  is an achievement worth celebrating. Liverpool did not even make the Champions League automatically  it had to endure a qualifier with Hoffenheim. This campaign is only its second in the Champions League since 2009  it has spent much of the intervening period trying to keep pace with the Premier League’s elite  Europe’s seemed beyond reach. The matter of what it has done is impressive  but the style in which it has done it is even more so. It has scored  in total  130 goals this season — eye-catching enough before two early eliminations in England’s domestic cups are factored in: Liverpool has only played 56 games. No team has ever scored more goals in a Champions League campaign than Liverpool. None That all of those records have been set by a team that did not have a single senior midfielder among its substitutes last night  that had an academy graduate at right-back  that deployed a left back who was playing in Scotland’s lower leagues four years ago  and that had to bring on Klavan — a seasoned pro  but hardly a world-beater — to see out the game is remarkable. “These boys are constantly over their limit ” Klopp said. That is testament to the work he has done  as much as the insatiability of his players. No wonder  then  that at the end  as Roma’s fans boomed out their club anthem in pride  Liverpool’s fans twirled their scarves in sheer  disbelieving delight  no wonder that Klopp reappeared  40 minutes after the final whistle  to celebrate again with the fans. The game itself needed some time to sink in  what Klopp and his players have done this season in Europe will require even longer. This season might still end without a trophy  of course. Defend like this against Real Madrid and it will most certainly be Real claiming a 13th European Cup in Kiev  not Liverpool lifting its sixth. But that is the thing with Liverpool  this Liverpool: Even Real  those wily old campaigners  will not be entirely sure of what they will have to face — the team lucky to get away with a 4-2 loss  or the team that has burned through Europe all year. For the rest of us  only one thing is certain: it will be worth staying until the end to find out. None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/07/sports/soccer/manchester-city-manchester-united-pogba.html,Paul Pogba and Manchester United Spoil City’s Championship Party Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None MANCHESTER  England — There were times in the first half  as Manchester City swept through Manchester United again and again  when it felt as if the plates had shifted  once and for all. Manchester City was two goals ahead  but the lead should have been three  or four  or five. In the Etihad Stadium stands  its fans were dizzy  delirious  fizzing with that manic feeling of a dream coming true  not sure whether to stare in awe at the field or turn and taunt the United fans penned behind one goal. Pep Guardiola’s City team was not just going to win the Premier League here  now. It was going to do so in the most perfect of circumstances — at home and against its greatest rival  the neighbor with the bigger house  the better car  the prettier children  the one that does not just cast a shadow but also blocks out the light — and in the most exquisite of styles. Seemingly at will  City cut and zipped through United’s defense. Guardiola’s players were too quick  too bright  too smart for the lumbering hulks José Mourinho had sent out to try to quell them. They moved in dazzling  hypnotic patterns  rising suddenly and then disappearing without a trace. This was the soccer Guardiola had promised  the soccer he had played all season  the soccer of the future. United looked like the past. City has won the league before  of course  since Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan  a scion of Abu Dhabi’s ruling family  arrived in Manchester in 2008: in 2012  with Sergio Aguero’s dramatic intervention in the final minute of the final game  and in 2014  when the passage was rather more scenic. But it has not  as yet  been able to burn off United. The inferiority complex that once marked City’s relationship with its neighbor has gone — mostly — and in recent years it has felt as if the blue half of Manchester is in the ascendancy and the red in decline. Still  it would be a stretch to say that  even in the worst period of United’s history for three decades  the balance of power in the city has inverted. United has won three titles since City came into wealth  and made a couple of Champions League finals. It has proved to be the only team in England truly capable of matching  almost  City’s spending in the transfer market. Its hegemony may have disappeared  but its potency has not. It has not gone quietly into the night. None Worse for United  perhaps  is that its coach  Mourinho  has long had the air of a man at odds not only with the club’s vaunted attacking traditions  but also with its self-confidence  its indomitable pride. He has set his team up a little too often to stymie high-caliber opponents  rather than to impose United’s style. He has talked a little too often of how United is a faded power  not quite what it once was  a team that should by now be accustomed to not winning championships  or to crashing out of the Champions League  its “football heritage” one of misses  near and not so near. City has always been the Manchester club consumed with self-doubt  and United the one with the peacock strut and the frontman swagger  whatever the weather. This season  they seemed to have swapped roles  and there were moments on Saturday  in that first half  that encapsulated it all. City pressed and United panicked  the reversal of roles in microcosm  a little window into what the future held: City racing clear  and United playing catch-up. And then  almost out of nowhere  everything snapped back. In the locker room at halftime  Mourinho warned his United players that they did not want to be the “clowns sort of standing there  watching them receive their trophy.” His team responded. In the space of two minutes  United was level  two goals created  at least in part  by Alexis Sanchez and scored by Paul Pogba  his hair dyed blue and white. Not long after  Mourinho’s team led  with Chris Smalling tapping home another Sanchez delivery. It was  just for a moment  a reminder of how things used to be  of what the real “football heritage” of these two teams is: City managing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory  what they used to call Cityitis  and United never quite understanding the concept of losing  able to win when other teams would be lost. In the short term  of course  it changes little  or nothing. Manchester City will still win the Premier League title. It will simply have to wait a little longer than it had hoped. It cannot claim a third championship in six years against Tottenham next week  it may  in reality  have to wait until the end of April to receive its prize  but it will get it. “They deserve it ” Mourinho said. In the long term  beyond this season  it is a reminder. “Never again  never again ” Guardiola had said  on the eve of this game  when asked if City would be able to dominate the Premier League next year  and the year after  the way it has over the last nine months. This season has been an exception  he said  it should not be seen as a rule. At the time  it felt like modesty. During that first half  it felt like misinformation. City was the future  United was just the last relic of the past. The plates had not just shifted  they were drifting apart. Now  though  it looks anything but. This has been City’s year  that will be confirmed soon enough. But United  like Liverpool  Tottenham  Chelsea and Arsenal  will gather again next year. The future is not quite so clear as it once appeared. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/soccer/real-madrid-bayern-munich-champions-league.html,Zinedine Zidane Has the Wins at Real Madrid. Where Is the Praise? Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None MUNICH — Unlikely as it seems  it may be time to consider the distinct possibility that Zinedine Zidane — winner of the Champions League in each of his first two seasons as a manager  and now on the brink of guiding Real Madrid to the competition’s final for a third year in a row — may be quite a good coach. That his brief managerial career has thus far delivered eight trophies in not quite 30 months should have made that perfectly obvious  of course  by this stage  the fact that he could steer his team to a 2-1 victory at Bayern Munich in the first leg of a Champions League semifinal should barely be worthy of note. Zidane the coach  not unlike Zidane the player  has known nothing but success. And yet the sort of acclaim that flows so freely toward some of his contemporaries  the breathless paeans of praise  the lavish adjectives  the exclamations of genius have  for some reason  continued to elude Zidane  even as he has picked up prize after prize. He often does not receive mention in discussion as to who  precisely  are the finest coaches of this generation. Pep Guardiola and José Mourinho  of course  would be the first to spring to mind  Zidane has won the Champions League as many times as either of them  and in a fraction of the time. None Why might that be? Perhaps it is  in part  because of the perception — one not rooted entirely in fantasy — that this Real Madrid team requires less coaching and more gentle calibration  that it is a side of such precision and finesse that the manager is reduced to something between a mascot and an administrator: there to hand in the lineup sheet and to cheerlead. Perhaps — and here  too  there is some reason — it is because of the great cult of the individual  one individual in particular  that has enveloped this Real Madrid for most of the last decade. No matter who the manager is  this will always be Cristiano Ronaldo’s team: its triumphs are his triumphs  its trophies are his trophies  almost always achieved through his own  divine intervention. Ronaldo always takes center stage  at Real Madrid  the coach is relegated to the supporting cast. But perhaps there is something else at play  too  a sense that Zidane can be overlooked because he does not fit the criteria we expect from a great 21st century coach. This is an age of the manager as visionary and philosopher  there not simply to hone the skills  maintain the fitness and direct the energies of elite athletes but to deploy them in the service of some grand idea  not just to make them a team  but to make them a story  to give them a purpose  an identity. That idea is appealing  of course  because it creates the illusion that someone is in control of the general chaos that defines even the most rarefied level of soccer. For fans and owners invested  emotionally and financially  in the sport  the idea that much of what happens on the field is down to random chance is deeply unsatisfactory  it is much more appealing to believe that one transcendent figure can master the mayhem. It is soccer’s avowed belief that the manager alone has that agency  that power: less coach  more guru. If that belief has plenty of historical antecedents — from Helenio Herrera of Inter Milan to Matt Busby of Manchester United — then it has found its greatest modern expression in Guardiola  designer of the first truly great team of the 21st century  the Barcelona of 2008-2012. Fans  and clubs  see Guardiola as a managerial paradigm: consumed by prophetic zeal  purveyor of a distinct  unequivocal style. He paces relentlessly on the touchline  trying to communicate his ideas to his players  to obtain his own inner peace through some sporting perfection. He talks at almost impossible speed  ideas forming and tumbling out of his brain almost too fast for him to verbalize them  he operates on a different level  sees the game more deeply  more clearly  than we can realize. Zidane does not fit that mold at all. He speaks slowly  deliberately  as if he is fastidiously refusing to say anything noteworthy. He is by nature taciturn  bordering on shy. He does not pretend to be the standard-bearer for a school of thought  to have some higher purpose  to wish to transform the game. He selects his team  and his team plays well  and — in the Champions League at least — invariably wins. In a culture that demands complication  he represents a simplicity bordering on asceticism. His successes  of course  are the most powerful proof that he is more than he seems  but there are the small details  too  the way he fulfills the most basic  most important requirement of a manager: to influence the course of an individual game. Wednesday’s victory was a case in point. Real Madrid did not  by any measure  play well. Bayern Munich took the lead  through Joshua Kimmich  and only conceded out of the blue  a momentary lapse in concentration allowing Marcelo to shoot home from the edge of the box. At halftime  Zidane discovered that he had to remove his playmaker and most impressive performer  Isco. He introduced Marco Asensio  instructing him to try to hold the ball  to relieve the insistent pressure on Real’s defense  and to lead his team on the counterattack. Ten minutes later  Asensio  on the counterattack  scored the winner. More impressive still was Zidane’s reaction to seeing Dani Carvajal  his right back  forced from the game through injury. He eschewed logic: Leading 2-1  he introduced Karim Benzema  a striker. Asensio switched to the right wing  Lucas Vázquez  a forward-thinking wide player  dropped to right-back. He wanted the pair’s pace to try to counteract Franck Ribery  Bayern’s vastly experienced winger. It worked  Bayern struggled to create chances of any sort in the final half-hour. Once might be dumb luck  but this is a pattern. In the first leg of the round of 16 game with Paris Saint-Germain  Zidane introduced Vázquez and Asensio  it was 1-1 when they came on  and 3-1 at the end. In the second leg of the quarterfinal against Juventus  he removed Casemiro and Gareth Bale at halftime  to try to limit the damage. Vázquez came on then  too  and won the penalty that saved Real. It is a characteristic all great managers share: a sense  spoken or not  of how a game is going  of how the balance might be altered. Zidane has it  in spades. In last year’s final  against Juventus  the game was finely poised at halftime. All he asked of his players  then  was to move five meters further forward. Real  tied 1-1 at the break  won 4-1. That skill is not quite as enticing  quite as compelling  as listening to a preacher expound his great vision of what soccer can be  it does not fuel the belief that someone is in control of the chaos. Rather  it embraces it  proves that even the slightest change can have vast consequences. It almost seems too easy to be worthy of comparison  too basic a task to be significant. Complexity  though  is not always importance. Zidane does the simple things well. He might  just might  know what he is doing.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/sports/soccer/leon-bailey-jamaica-leverkusen.html,The Jamaican Who Isn’t Sure He Wants to Play for Jamaica Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None LEVERKUSEN  Germany — As far as Leon Bailey is concerned  he has been representing Jamaica on the international stage since he was 12 years old. He may never have played for his country  not competitively. He may stand accused of lacking patriotic pride because he cannot guarantee that he will ever do so. But as he outlines his long  remarkable journey from Kingston  all the way to Bayer Leverkusen  the Bundesliga and the cusp of stardom  he makes it perfectly clear that — in his eyes  at least — who you are is not just where you are from. Wearing a jersey is not the only way to fly a flag. Over the last two years  first with Belgium’s K.R.C. Genk and now with Leverkusen  the 20-year-old Bailey has emerged as one of the most dazzling prospects in European soccer  a wing of blistering speed and rare talent. Leverkusen saw off interest from clubs in England to sign him in January 2017  but the club privately accepts that his performances since then guarantee that the Premier League’s big beasts  among others  will soon be back. That is not the only feeding frenzy Bailey has triggered  however. He has played only once for Jamaica  his homeland — in an exhibition game for its under-23 team in 2015. The senior team “would love” to be able to call on him  according to Michael Ricketts  the president of the Jamaican Football Federation  but to date Bailey has refused frequent invitations to join up. Until he does  as far as FIFA is concerned  he is a citizen of nowhere. Given his gifts and his youth  that has not gone unnoticed. Soccer officials in Belgium have investigated whether Bailey might be able to represent them. England  encouraged by a suggestion that Bailey has British ancestry  has sent scouts to assess him. His current home  Germany  has fielded several naturalized players in recent years  drawn from nations as diverse as South Africa and Brazil. Just how feasible any of those options are is open for debate: While Bailey believes he is eligible for England  for example  the link seems to be through his adoptive family  which would not meet FIFA’s criteria. What is beyond question is that Bailey is prepared to explore any and all options — including  perhaps  even reassessing his Jamaican one. “Of course  if something was put down in front of me by a country that could compete  I would consider it ” he said. His priority  at this moment  is his club career  but he said he was conscious that “in football  the years you play are limited  and I cannot wait all my life to play in a national team.” He will not definitively rule out that team being Jamaica — “I would never say never” — but he does not seem hopeful. He has called for sweeping changes at the J.F.F.  but he knows such things “take years” to carry out. “If I saw change  that would help me make a decision ” he said. “If they are willing to put a system in place  develop as a nation  then it would make me want to play. But until they make that change  I will focus on myself.” None “You either want to play for Jamaica or you don’t ” the former international Paul Hall said this year. Ricketts has suggested that Bailey is caught in the middle of a power struggle. He has accused Bailey’s adoptive father  agent and mentor  Craig Butler  of wanting “a job at the Jamaican Football Federation in exchange for his son” playing for the national team. Outside the Caribbean  too  Bailey’s equivocation sits uneasily. Choosing a country is not supposed to be like choosing a team: It is meant to be a matter of the heart  not the head. Some  like the Brazilian-born Portuguese internationals Pepe and Deco  change nationality with little problem  it was accepted that their loyalty to their adoptive nation was genuine. Others attract more scorn: Diego Costa  choosing between Brazil and Spain  Adnan Januzaj  working out whether to represent Albania  Kosovo  Serbia  England or Belgium  or Jonathan Gonzalez  preferring to represent Mexico over the United States. All were seen to be putting their own interests first  asking not what they could do for a country  but what a country could do for them. Bailey’s case does not lend itself to such a binary assessment. He is in no doubt that he is Jamaican — “100 percent Jamaican ” he said — and he rejects the idea that he is considering shedding his nationality  or his identity. “If I played for Germany  it does not mean I do not love my country ” he said. “You know you are still Jamaican. That is where you were born.” That is something Bailey has been conscious of ever since he left Jamaica — perhaps earlier  right back to the moment  at the age of 8  that he first encountered the key figure in his rise: his adoptive father  Butler. Bailey remembers his childhood fondly. He grew up in Cassava Piece  a troubled suburb of Kingston not far from the Phoenix All Star Academy  a soccer training center Butler owned. Bailey started attending when he was 8 and quickly grew close to Butler. He remembered “staying at his house  going to school from his place  doing everything together.” Eventually  though Bailey remains in touch with his birth family — his younger sister led him out onto the field for a Leverkusen game in March — Butler formally adopted him. It is Butler whom Bailey refers to as Dad  and Butler’s son  Kyle  whom Bailey considers his brother. “Blood ” he said  “does not make you family.” When Bailey was 12  Butler  convinced he could not fulfill his potential amid the privations of Jamaican soccer  decided to take him and Kyle Butler to Europe. They flew to Austria  for a trial with Red Bull Salzburg. They had little money to tide them over and no idea how long they would be away. “I did not know when I would come back ” Bailey said. “I was 12. I just did whatever my dad said.” He would not go home  or see his mother  for four years. He played for various teams in Austria — some officially  some simply on trial — and had spells training with Genk in Belgium  Ajax in the Netherlands and A.S. Trencin in Slovakia. At 17  he was forced to return to Jamaica because of problems with his paperwork. But at 18  as soon as FIFA’s rules allowed it  he signed a contract with Genk. By the end of his first season  he had been voted the best young player in Belgium. Leverkusen had become aware of him years earlier  during a trial at Ajax. “We heard there was this crazily talented Jamaican kid there ” said Jonas Boldt  the club’s sporting manager. As Bailey started to attract notice in Belgium  the club’s scouts recommended him again. Intrigued  Boldt went to watch him. He made up his mind instantly. While Bailey’s other suitors debated his merits  Leverkusen moved in hard in January 2017 and signed him. “It has been a long journey ” Bailey said. Through it all  though  he has been driven not only by his own ambition to be “classified as the best player in the world ” but by something grander. “Everyone’s dream at the Phoenix academy is to become a pro ” Bailey said. “We were the best from the academy  so we had to go and show our quality so we could open the doors for the others ” he added. “We were just the first pioneers to break through  to pave the way for young Jamaicans.” To Bailey  that is the best way to represent his country  and he does not need to wear its jersey to do that. He pauses when asked if it would mean as much to play for Germany  Belgium or England as it would to pull on the green  black and gold of Jamaica  then says he thinks it would. “When you live in a place for a while  you get to know its culture and its people ” he said. He draws a parallel with Raheem Sterling  a close friend who was born in Kingston but now represents Manchester City and England. “Raheem considers himself Jamaican  but he still loves England ” he said. “He lived in England  and he lived in Jamaica  and he feels more the vibe coming from Jamaica. But if you have a decision to make to play for England or Jamaica  there is nothing to think about.” Bailey will always be Jamaican. He will always consider himself a representative of Jamaica  whatever nation he ends up choosing. But that does not mean he believes that nationality is fixed  that who you are is only where you are from. Blood does not make you family  and wearing a jersey is not the only way to fly a flag.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/sports/soccer/arsene-wenger-arsenal.html,Arsène Wenger Will Leave Arsenal  Proudly but Imperfectly Advertisement Supported by On Soccer None LONDON — Now  then  it is time to make amends. Time for all of the mutineers to lay down their cudgels. Time for those who had drifted away  in apathy and in anger  to return. Time for the swaths of empty seats that have littered Emirates Stadium to be filled once more. It is probably too late for a statue to be unveiled  but not for one to be commissioned  at least. Arsène Wenger would understand if it was not ready for Arsenal’s final home game of the season — against Burnley  on May 6 — or even for what may be his last match as Arsenal manager  a visit to Huddersfield Town  a week later. He knows  more than most  that a labor of love can take time. This week  under increasing pressure from Arsenal’s suite of executives and in the midst of long-running discontent among the club’s fans  Wenger decided that he would do the one thing he said he would never do: He would break a contract. These weeks  he told Arsenal’s board  will be his last in a job he has held for 22 years. Before training on Friday  he informed his players that he would step down as manager at the end of the season. An hour or so later  the club announced it to the world. None None All of those eulogies are true  of course. Wenger’s longevity  as Ferguson highlighted  is an achievement in itself. The loyalty between him and the club “of his heart ” as he has always put it  is increasingly an anachronism in soccer’s age of impatience. It is the end of an era not just for Arsenal  but for the sport as a whole  too  in that sense. There will be no more who do what Wenger did  for as long as he did. He did  as others mentioned  shape some of the finest teams England has seen: the one that won the Premier League and F.A. Cup in his first full season  built on the granite defense he had inherited  the Invincibles of Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira in 2004  the team that came within 12 minutes of winning the Champions League in 2006. In doing so  he transformed what Arsenal was  how it was seen  across the globe. That is Wenger’s legacy  just as much as the sleek  space-age stadium the club built on the back of his success and the state-of-the-art training facility he helped design: Arsenal had not always been seen as a bastion of taste and style in England  let alone around the world. None Wenger was only the second foreign manager to be appointed to an English club having never experienced the game on these shores. The first  the Czechoslovak Jozef Venglos  arrived at Aston Villa in 1990 championing similar methods to Wenger’s  and left not long after  his players unable  or unwilling  to adapt. Wenger was greeted by similar skepticism. What does he know of England  he who comes from Japan  as Ferguson — unwittingly bastardizing Kipling — almost put it. When Wenger immediately set about recruiting a battalion of French players  he was greeted by a wave of doubters and critics. A year later  he won the title  and then the cup. Wenger proved that foreign managers could cut it in an island obsessed with its own exceptionalism. It is for all of that he should be remembered  his unyielding allies and recently converted admirers claimed on Friday  not for these last few years of drift and despair. Those long seasons punctuated by three F.A. Cup wins but dominated by the sight of Arsenal  of Wenger  being overtaken by Chelsea  by Manchester City and  worst of all  by Tottenham Hotspur  of a club first unable to compete in the Champions League and then eliminated from it entirely  of a stadium slowly emptying as fans lost patience and then hope  of a board paralyzed by its awe for an employee  of a man unable to turn away. All of that should be written out of the record  cast into shadow by the searing brightness of what went before. It does not work like that  of course  nor should it. Wenger’s second act is just as central to his legacy as his first  and the questions of why he could not halt the decline — why  for so long  he did not seem to notice it  why he kept pursuing the same solution  believing the outcome would be different  why he allowed the final years of his reign to be marked more by sadness than glory — are just as relevant as how he managed to kick-start the club’s ascent all those years ago. A few years ago  in one of those many low moments that seemed to prompt a bout of soul-searching in Wenger  he contemplated how he wanted to leave Arsenal for his successor. At the annual meeting of the club’s shareholders  he talked about how he wanted to bequeath a team primed for immediate  continuing success  one in ruder health than ever before. It is hard to argue he has achieved that. No matter who replaces him — and a young  ambitious coach to re-energize a torpid club is the order of the day — that person will have to rebuild morale  reshape the squad and restore purpose. That job will be more difficult this year than it would have been had Wenger stepped down in  say  2014. Nor will it be the work of just one man. Perhaps the most eloquent testimony to Wenger’s greatness came not in the words poured out in his honor over the last 24 hours  but in the work Arsenal has been doing to prepare for this day over the last 12 months. Raul Sanllehi has come in from Barcelona as director of football operations. Sven Mislintat  his reputation forged at Borussia Dortmund  is the new chief scout. The legal expert Huss Fahmy was drafted in from cycling’s Team Sky to work on contracts. Billy Beane  a friend of Wenger’s  has always preached the need not to find like-for-like replacements for players  but to try to replace the aggregate of what they provided. Arsenal has recognized that it will take four people  effectively  to stand in for Wenger. That is the highest of praise  but it is also fitting recognition that Wenger was no longer a man of his time: Soccer clubs are now too vast  too complex as organizations  to be overseen by just one person. Wenger was the last of the all-powerful managers  the institution he represented  the way of thinking  is past. That  in part  is why he has been overtaken  why he lost his way. None of that means that he should not be given a monthlong valedictory tour not just by Arsenal  but by the country he graced for 22 years  the country he changed  just a little  in his own image. Nor does the fact that he was imperfect  that he stayed on too long  that he departs not with garlands but regrets  mean he does not warrant a statue. In the ancient world  even monuments to the gods contained physical imperfections  a simple metaphor. They are great  and they deserve to be remembered  and cherished  and idolized. But they have their flaws  too  just as we all do. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/07/sports/rugby/07reuters-rugby-union-usa.html,"Rugby-Major League Rugby Set to Be a Game-Changer: Fitzpatrick Advertisement Supported by None HOUSTON — A rugby revolution is taking place in the United States where it is hoped the launch of a new professional league will unlock the potential of the game in the world’s biggest sports market  former Ireland international Justin Fitzpatrick said. Fitzpatrick is coach of the Houston SaberCats  one of seven sides competing in the inaugural season of Major League Rugby (MLR) that kicked off last month  the latest attempt by the 15-man game to gain traction in North America. ""The potential in this market is huge and rugby has been the fastest growing sport in the U.S. in the past five years "" Fitzpatrick told Reuters. ""Major League Rugby is the logical step in unlocking that potential and already we are seeing a tremendous response to the competition. ""I firmly believe that in 15 or 20 years  Major League Rugby could rival Super Rugby and the top European leagues. That is the potential that exists here from both a playing and commercial point of view."" Prior to the start of the season  MLR signed television deals with ESPN and CBS Sports Network  which ensured that all 31 games will be broadcast nationally. ""We are the first professional sport to have a national broadcasting deal right out of the gate. That is huge "" Fitzpatrick said. ""When you combine the elements that our game has visually – it is a fast-paced and collision-based sport  but also has the elements of respect  it is an easy sell to America. Once they are exposed to it  as they have been in growing numbers  they fall in love with the sport."" The league currently has teams from Austin  Houston  Glendale (Colorado)  New Orleans  San Diego  Seattle and Salt Lake City  with a New York side to start competing from 2019. ""To have an American competition that brings that inter-city rivalry and allows rugby to be accessible to more local markets is going to really help grow the game "" Fitzpatrick said. ""In an American sporting context  that's how it works – Seattle playing Houston  Chicago playing Atlanta. You have to have that intercity rivalry. ""If we can get 10-12 teams in the next few years  which is looking very promising  we will be in a strong position."" With teams restricted to five foreign imports  MLR is hoping to draw players primarily from two areas – both largely untapped to this point. ""How many incredible athletes fall just short of making it to the major sports in America? Be it American football or basketball  only a very small percentage go on to play professionally "" said Fitzpatrick.  SCHOOL RUGBY ""But what happens to the rest? Most just give up  but we want to be able to give those tremendous athletes an opportunity to play professional sport. We have already had players cross over with some success. ""Most have never played rugby before  so it is a process to teach them the sport  but they come with such incredible athletic ability that it is very exciting."" Fitzpatrick acknowledges that for rugby to truly succeed in the U.S.  they need players engaged from an early age  not only to play the game  but also become supporters of the sport. ""Over the last five years a lot of that has happened at youth and high school level. Even 10 years ago  most guys or girls were coming into the sport at the college level "" he said. ""That is starting to change and in terms of demographic  youth and schools rugby is much bigger than club rugby in Houston.  ""We understand that we need to expose kids to rugby at earlier ages and give them avenues to play and compete. We have been partnering with high schools and colleges to help grow their efforts and now we can offer them a professional team as an outlet."" The SaberCats are also hoping to break ground on their own stadium in Houston this month. ""To be building what will be the number one purpose-built rugby stadium in the U.S. is very exciting "" he said.  ""It speaks volumes about how far the game has grown that people  whether it be in the corporate world  government or the local community  are so excited about rugby. ""I toured here with Ireland in 2000 and we played in New Hampshire in front of 2 000 or 3 000 people. Fifteen years later I was sitting in a box at Soldier Field  one of the most iconic venues in sport  with 65 000 people there to watch the USA play New Zealand. ""Look on cable TV and see how accessible rugby is  when it wasn’t probably even 10 years ago. Whether it is Super Rugby  the (English) Premiership  Championship Rugby or the Six Nations  it is there to be watched.""

The Lions had trailled 24-0 at halftime and 27-0 early in the second half before they struck back with two tries to hooker Malcolm Marx to get to 27-12 with 20 minutes remaining. The errors that had blighted their first-half performance  which led to tries for the Reds to JP Smith  Caleb Timu  Brandon Paenga-Amosa and George Smith  hurt them again in the final quarter as they failed to complete the comeback despite two late tries to replacement Marnus Schoeman.

JJ Engelbrecht went over for two tries and fellow Springboks Damian de Allende and Dillyn Leyds also scored for the home side with Sefa Naivalu going over twice for the Australians. The Stormers threatened a runaway score as they dominated early with three unanswered tries before the Rebels staged a comeback and reduced the deficit to nine points in the closing stages. But a try on the final whistle for Engelbrecht ensured a healthy winning margin for the hosts. HURRICANES 43 SUNWOLVES 15 Inside centre Vince Aso crossed for four tries but only two of them counted as the Hurricanes moved to the top of the standings following their victory over Japan's Sunwolves. Aso  who crossed in the 74th and 79th minute  had two tries ruled out earlier by television match official Ben Skeen - the first for a marginal forward pass from Julian Savea and then for a dangerous clear out by Ardie Savea some 70 metres downfield. Julian Savea  Finlay Christie  Reed Prinsep  Jordie Barrett and Brad Shields also scored for the home side  who moved to 32 points on the table  two ahead of the Lions and three in front of the defending champion Canterbury Crusaders.  The Hurricanes  who had won their last six games  only put the game beyond doubt in the final six minutes with three tries -- two of which were scored by Aso.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/09/sports/rugby/09reuters-rugby-union-australia-folau.html,"Rugby-Folau's Religious Beliefs Complicate Contract Negotiations Advertisement Supported by None SYDNEY — Israel Folau's negotiation over a new Rugby Australia contract looks like being a protracted process accompanied by the usual interest from other quarters but complicated this time by his insistence on standing by his religious beliefs. As a former rugby league international who spent a couple of years playing top flight Australian Rules  the 29-year-old outside back is by far the best known rugby union player in a country where the other two football codes rule the roost. After five successful seasons  though  Folau's contract will be up at the end of the year and Rugby Australia will be desperate to get him to extend at least through next year's Rugby World Cup in Japan. The rugby league media pack has never fathomed why Folau  or anyone  would turn his back on their game so he is linked to a return to the National Rugby League at every contract renegotiation.  Wealthy European and Japanese union clubs are always circling  while on Tuesday there was a report in the Daily Telegraph that Folau had discussed a move back to Brisbane  where he grew up  with the coach of the Queensland Reds. The New South Wales Waratahs will be hoping that report was a false lead as they look to secure the services of a player whose athletic ability is most often described as ""freakish"". His social media postings have brought wider issues into the equation  though -- the latest coming on Twitter on Tuesday which linked to an 11-minute sermon from the late Christian evangelist David Wilkerson.  It included a warning from the American against young people being ""seduced"" into ""tolerance"" towards same-sex marriage  recalling for some Folau's comment on Instagram last month that homosexuals were destined for ""hell"" unless they repented.  Folau's remark caused outrage in some quarters but Rugby Australia declined to censure him despite pressure from key sponsors such as airline Qantas  who the cash-strapped governing body can barely afford to lose. Folau  a former Mormon who now attends a church allied to the Pentecostal Assemblies of God  said last year that he would not support legislation allowing gay marriage during nationwide plebiscite over the issue. Australia's parliament voted to legalise same-sex marriage in December after the vote returned an overwhelming majority in favour of same sex unions. Folau said in a post on the PlayersVoice website last month that he had offered to walk away from his Rugby Australia contract immediately if the position became ""untenable"" for the sport. And while his wife Maria tweeted last weekend to complain about Folau being played on the wing rather than at fullback for the Waratahs  he has flatly denied courting controversy as a negotiating position.  ""That simply isn't true "" he wrote. ""There have been rugby offers from the UK  Europe and Japan that are way above anything I could earn in Australia. ""This is not about money or bargaining power or contracts. It's about what I believe in and never compromising that  because my faith is far more important to me than my career and always will be.""

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/04/sports/rugby/04reuters-rugby-union-worldseries.html,"Rugby-The Force Awakens in World Series Tournament Advertisement Supported by None MELBOURNE — The governing body of Australian rugby deemed Western Force a dead weight before axeing them from Super Rugby last year but the Perth-based team will live again during the World Series Rugby tournament. The Force takes on a Fijian side in their first match on Friday and will host a grab-bag of other Asia-Pacific teams in the seven-match competition that introduces a slew of new rules aimed at rejuvenating the game and finding a new audience. Rugby union  very much a fringe sport in a market dominated by rugby league and Australian Rules football  has been on the wane Down Under. Australia's national Wallabies side has not held the Bledisloe Cup  the annual trophy contested with New Zealand  since 2002  and crowds to local Super Rugby matches have plummeted since the Sydney-based New South Wales Waratahs claimed the 2014 championship.  World Series Rugby's creator Andrew Forrest  an iron ore magnate and prominent philanthropist in Western Australia state  has big ambitions for the tournament in the long-term  and believes it could ultimately challenge Super Rugby's primacy in the southern hemisphere. But he freely admits it was born out of a personal sense of injustice  for both the team and the state that Sydney-based Rugby Australia turned their backs on. The Force  who joined Super Rugby in 2007  were cut after a messy and opaque process that put them on the chopping block with the Melbourne Rebels. The Rebels  who joined the competition four years after the Force and have bled red ink in their seven seasons  were spared. ""I don't do anything by halves "" Forrest told local media this week. ""It is patently obvious to most people in the rugby community now that the selection process (between Force and Rebels) was a charade. So this is about helping address that unfairness."" Forrest offered to donate A$3 million ($2.26 million) to Rugby Australia to retain Force in Super Rugby but was brushed off by chairman Cameron Clyne. He has instead ploughed his money into the World Series which aims to speed the game up with a number of rule changes. It will feature seven-point ""power tries"" awarded when teams take the ball out from behind their own 22-metre line and cross without coughing up possession or committing a penalty. Set pieces  a part of rugby that often tests viewers' patience  will be quicker  with a one-minute time limit placed on scrums. Teams will also be allowed up to 12 substitutions  up from the traditional eight. Plenty of scepticism surrounds the tournament's ability to generate fan interest and sponsors  but the Force's opener against the Fijian Warriors is expected to draw over 15 000 people to Perth Rectangular Stadium  a decent crowd by Super Rugby standards. The match will also be broadcast live on a free-to-air channel in Western Australia  and on a delayed broadcast to other states. Super Rugby is broadcast exclusively by a pay-TV provider.  Officials at World Rugby are certain to be among the interested viewers  to see the market's response to a tournament that borrows heavily from the ideas that underpinned cricket's reinvention through the Twenty20 format. Rugby Australia  mindful of Super Rugby's problems  may also watch with some anxiety.

https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/05/sports/rugby/05reuters-rugby-union-super-australia.html,"Rugby-Australia's Wait Goes On as Waratahs Fail to Fire Advertisement Supported by None SYDNEY — Australia's bid to break the Super Rugby stranglehold of their New Zealand rivals looks set to go on for at least another two weeks after the New South Wales Waratahs blew an opportunity to end the streak at 37 matches on Saturday night. The Waratahs enjoyed three quarters of the possession against the Auckland Blues but still failed to become the first Australian team to beat opposition from the other side of the Tasman Sea in 38 matches since May 27  2016.  The Blues might be by far the poorest of the five New Zealand franchises but it was only courtesy of a late try from Michael Hooper that the losing margin was restricted to three points at 24-21. The chances of the stranglehold being broken next week look bleak with the Waratahs heading to Christchurch to take on the might of the Canterbury Crusaders  the champions and competition leaders who crushed the Melbourne Rebels 55-10 on Friday. The Queensland Reds have the next chance after that when they visit the Wellington Hurricanes on May 18  although form suggests the Waratahs' match against the Otago Highlanders the following day might be a better bet. Should they fail  the Waratahs would have another turn against the Waikato Chiefs on May 26  a day shy of the two-year anniversary of their 45-25 win over the same opposition that remains the last Australian success.  ""It's a big narrative "" said Waratahs captain Hooper.  ""We can only control what we're doing  and the other teams are probably going to say the same thing  but we've got another three games against these guys  three good cracks and we're going to focus week to week and this one hurts. ""It is disappointing  but we've got to go again. Every game's tough. We're fully aware of that."" New Zealand teams have dominated Super Rugby for the last few years but they have shown in recent weeks that they can be beaten by big  physical sides with Argentina's Jaguares  for example  winning away at the Blues and the Chiefs.  Extrapolating Super Rugby form to the test arena is often misleading but it must be a concern for Australia coach Michael Cheika that a team like the Waratahs  which contains most of the leading Wallabies  are failing to fire. The elimination of the Western Force was supposed to concentrate Australia talent in the remaining four franchises and while it may be early to expect significant results  it must also be a worry that only the Waratahs have a winning record.  Australia did at least manage to beat the All Blacks last year but they will kick off this international season in June with a tough assignment in a three-test series against Six Nations champions Ireland.

The Brad Thorn-coached Reds notched their fourth win of the season over the weekend  scraping home 27-22 against the Johannesburg-based Lions  last year's runnersup and the dominant side in South Africa. A week after being routed 36-12 by New Zealand's visiting Waikato Chiefs  Thorn's youthful side needed to respond in front of long-suffering home fans. One-test Wallabies prop Taniela Tupou was one of nine players aged 21 or under who were thrown to the second-placed Lions and ultimately enjoyed a standing ovation from sections of the Lang Park crowd. ""We had a good chat last week  had a team meeting where we discussed what we needed to work on and we worked on it all week "" Tupou told Reuters on Monday. ""And then we put it out there on the weekend and got the job done  so that was good. ""We’ve just got to keep it up and see how we go."" Under former All Blacks enforcer Thorn  who took the reins from the sacked Nick Stiles in the off-season  the Reds have already equalled their highest wins tally of the previous three campaigns. With eight rounds left in the regular season  they have lifted themselves to third in the Australian conference  seven points shy of the leading New South Wales Waratahs. Top spot in Australia would be enough to secure their first playoffs berth since 2013. ""If we play like we did on the weekend  we get a few more wins  hopefully "" said 134-kg Tupou  who made his Wallabies debut against Scotland in November. 'THORNY' Times have been tough for the Reds since their first and only championship in 2011  when bumper crowds watched halfbacks Quade Cooper and Will Genia bamboozle opponents from across the southern hemisphere. But a buzz has returned to Lang Park with the elevation of Thorn  who coached the Reds' youth side to the national title last year. The 43-year-old has shown scant regard for sentiment or media opinions  refusing to pick former Wallabies flyhalf Cooper while backing a number of his under-20s proteges. It's difficult  maybe dangerous  not to listen to dual international Thorn  who won a World Cup with New Zealand  a Super Rugby title with the Canterbury Crusaders and a National Rugby League championship with the Brisbane Broncos. ""He’s a no-bullshit kind of guy  like  you just can’t bullshit him. He’s a tough man on the field at training "" said Tupou. ""He wants everything to be absolutely spot on. Obviously with Thorny  you know  he’s a winner. He’s won pretty much everything. When he speaks to you  you kind of want to listen because you know he’s done it all."" With last year's harrowing axeing of Perth-based team Western Force still fresh in the memory and a 36-game losing streak to New Zealand opponents  Australian rugby could do with a good news story. With a bye this week  the Reds will pause and reset before continuing their playoffs bid away to the Sunwolves in Tokyo. Attention will turn to the next attempts to break the New Zealand hoodoo  with the Melbourne Rebels hosting the champion Canterbury Crusaders on Friday. Should the Rebels fail  the Waratahs will be under huge pressure to win at home on Saturday against the injury-stricken Auckland Blues  the bottom team in the New Zealand conference. Tonga-born Tupou was a schoolboy sensation in New Zealand but turned down a national contract to move to Australia at the age of 18. He has endured plenty of banter from his former classmates about the losing streak to New Zealand sides  which dates all the way back to 2016. ""We need to finish that because I'm hating seeing in the media  New Zealand this  New Zealand that "" said the 21-year-old.

In autumn last year  Gilpin expressed nervousness at the challenges that still lay ahead for organisers  yet he now believes huge strides have been taken towards hosting a successful tournament.

""Six months ago we had some concerns  particularly around ensuring the environment for the teams was going to be what it needed it be for rugby's leading competition -- the very best.""

""The organising committee  host cities and prefectures have responded really well  so we are really happy with the team camp selection process "" stressed Gilpin. The other significant change from six months ago is that tickets have now been on sale since mid-January  with World Rugby delighted by more than 1.2 million applications so far. Gilpin estimates that 65 percent of those have been domestic. ""It shows fantastic demand and it is not just the Japan matches  it is not just the knockout matches  it is across all the venues "" he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/sports/golf/augusta-national-womens-tournament.html,Augusta National Takes an Unexpected Turn Toward Women’s Golf Advertisement Supported by On Golf None AUGUSTA  Ga. — Almost 16 years ago  when the Augusta National Golf Club became a battleground over its exclusively male membership  it was hard to imagine that the club’s chairman would one day support women’s golf in a groundbreaking way. None But on Wednesday  Fred Ridley  in his first major appearance as the new chairman of Augusta National  unexpectedly announced that the club would create and help host the Augusta National Women’s Amateur Championship next year. The 54-hole tournament will be played the week before the 2019 Masters  with the first two rounds at a local club near Augusta and the final round at Augusta National on April 6  a Saturday. The objective is to grow the game of golf and to benefit women’s golf at all levels. The event may accomplish both goals quickly since it will most likely be the most watched women’s golf tournament of 2019. “This is a dream come true ” said the retired star Annika Sorenstam  who attended the announcement. “It will be an exciting carrot for these young amateurs.” The ripple effects could be considerable and multifaceted. Young girls around the world taking up golf can now aspire to a heretofore unfathomable ambition: winning a national women’s championship at the celebrated home of the Masters. The tournament  coming just before the Masters  should soon become a spring broadcasting fixture attracting more converts to golf. There will most likely be other consequences. The women’s professional tours have in recent years seen a throng of teenagers joining their ranks  and not always with the best results for the young players. A chance to play in a new national championship at Augusta National might stem the rising tide of adolescents by making the amateur option more appealing. The change may also persuade more female college golfers to remain in school  since there is a new title to chase. Those golfers might find their parents enthusiastically backing a decision to remain on campus  because mom and dad probably long for the chance to get inside the gates at Augusta National  too. The inception of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur Championship is good news for other non-competitors as well. Tickets to the Masters are among the most sought-after in American sports  in part because of the course’s renowned aesthetics and design. Ridley  who became the club’s chairman last October  did not disclose details about how many fans would be allowed to attend the new event  but it will undoubtedly be a hot ticket and bring more attention to the women’s game. What is known is that the tournament will have an international field of 72 elite players. Winners from various recognized amateur championships  including the United States Women’s Amateur  will be invited along with many of the highest ranked women in the world amateur golf ranking. The first two 18-hole rounds will take place at the Champions Retreat Golf Club in Evans  Ga. Ridley said he considered the new tournament to be an extension of Masters week  which also includes a youth drive  chip and putt championship on the Sunday before the main event. The new women’s tournament could  however  create a scheduling conflict for the L.P.G.A. The ANA Inspiration  the first major of the year on the women’s calendar  is held the week before the Masters. Ridley said Wednesday that he had spoken to L.P.G.A. Commissioner Michael Whan and that Whan had agreed that the new championship would have a positive long-term impact on women’s golf. In 2002  Augusta National received exacting scrutiny over its membership policies after Martha Burk  then the head of the National Council of Women’s Organizations  wrote a private letter to the club’s chairman at the time  William Johnson  questioning its exclusion of women. Johnson answered Burk with a sharply worded news release that said  in part: “There may well come a day when women will be invited to join our membership  but that timetable will be ours  and not at the point of a bayonet.” An ensuing firestorm included extensive news media coverage and a small protest led by Burk near the gates of Augusta National during the 2003 Masters. The mood at the club on Wednesday was far more conciliatory  and it appeared the golf world had Ridley to thank for that. Asked what motivated him to help grow the women’s game  Ridley  a former United States Amateur champion  answered: “I just felt that there was an opportunity and a platform to make a statement as to how we feel about this part of the game. I just felt it was time to do that. I happen to have three daughters  and they all love golf. They’re not really very good players  but they all love the game. And I know they’re going to be really excited about this.” None None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/sports/golf/tiger-woods-valspar-championship.html,He Stuck to Golf: Tiger Woods  Roaring Back  Ties for 2nd Advertisement Supported by On Golf None PALM HARBOR  Fla. — The most remarkable aspect of Tiger Woods’s comeback isn’t how quickly his ball-striking rounded into shape after two years of relative inactivity or how well he handled the crucible of contending after being sidelined for so long. To Wayne Gretzky  who watched the weekend telecast of the Valspar Championship with great interest  the most impressive part of Woods’s second-place finish was that he was back competing at all. Woods  42  could have limped off the main stage with his legacy secure. After $110 million in career earnings on the course and several times that much off it  after more than 100 worldwide victories  including 14 majors  after two decades of being saddled with a superhero cape that is one loose thread from unraveling into infamy  Woods could have become a full-time chauffeur and cheerleader for his two children  a part-time fisherman and scuba diver and an occasional adrenaline junkie who satisfied his cravings through bungee jumping  sky diving or heli-skiing. Before carding a final-round one-under 70 to finish tied for second  one stroke behind the Englishman Paul Casey  for his first top-three finish since 2013  Woods could have drifted from the sport. He could have concentrated on his golf-design projects  his restaurant business and his foundation-funded learning labs. That Woods chose instead to rejoin a tour that in his absence had become the domain of players nearly half his age impressed Gretzky  the Hall of Fame hockey player. “I think it shows how much he loves the sport ” Gretzky said in a telephone interview. “That sends a great message that the best athlete in the world in his sport is the hardest working and the guy that loves the game the most and still wants to win the most.” Gretzky  who still owns or holds a share of dozens of N.H.L. records  added  “The Good Lord blessed us with talent  but to be the greatest you have to outwork everyone  too.” On the eve of Sunday’s final round at Innisbrook’s Copperhead resort  Notah Begay III  Golf Channel’s on-course reporter and a member of Woods’s small inner circle  gave an illuminating explanation for Woods’s resplendent short game  the aspect of his play that failed him spectacularly in his limited starts the past two years. Begay  a teammate of Woods’s at Stanford  said that Woods had installed four practice greens in his Jupiter  Fla.  backyard  including one that replicates the putting surfaces at the Bay Hill course where he has won eight times. Begay added that Woods employed someone to tend the greens who worked at Augusta National  home of the Masters  which Woods has won four times. “It is one of the advantages he has by having that practice facility when he walks right outside of his house ” Begay said during the Golf Channel telecast  adding  “It is one of the things he was able to do the most — putting and chipping — throughout all of these injuries.” Woods and the rest of the field started Sunday chasing Corey Conners  a 26-year-old PGA Tour rookie from Canada who had held the lead since the first round. Conners’s best finish in his first 10 starts of the wraparound season was a tie for 29th. When Woods was Conners’s age  he had 30 PGA Tour titles. Woods’s 20s were the days when his mastery of courses and his domination of his competition combined to make him seem more machine than man. He commanded awe while appearing only remotely accessible  like a Rembrandt painting hanging in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Woods’s native Southern California. The public assumed he would be around to admire for years and years. But then came the injuries to Woods’s knees  neck  shoulder and back. There were also the indignities  including the public unraveling of Woods’s marriage after his indiscretions were made public and a D.U.I. arrest last May for the misuse of prescription medicine. At the Presidents Cup last September  Woods  an assistant captain for the United States team  acknowledged that he could envision a scenario in which he did not return to competitive golf. He was five months removed from back fusion surgery and had not been cleared by his doctors to make full swings. While he took his first tentative shots with his long irons and woods  Justin Rose  who finished tied for fifth Sunday  was winning back-to-back tournaments in China and Turkey. When Woods said he didn’t know what the future held for him  fans of his golfing artistry were left to face the prospect of never seeing another of his signature masterpieces. Perhaps that explains the wildly enthusiastic receptions that Woods received here and at the first three stops of his comeback tour. In an interview Friday  Begay said it seemed to him as if fans were hungry to show Woods their appreciation for how he changed the game while he was still around to soak it in. “Everyone loves a comeback story  and the underdog  and Tiger became the underdog ” Begay said. “Just two months ago he was ranked outside the top 1 000 and was overcoming multiple back surgeries and sort of was the punch line on late-night comedy because of everything that had gone on. But through all the trials and tribulations  he nonetheless has found a way to persevere and get back to a level of performance that is literally unbelievable.” Brandt Snedeker  37  has enjoyed one of the best vantage points for Woods’s comeback. Snedeker has been in the same group for five of the 14 official rounds that Woods has logged. From what Snedeker has seen  the renewed appreciation being shown Woods by the fans is being reciprocated in kind. Woods is making more eye contact  signing more autographs  smiling more. “I think he’s more at peace with his role in golf ” Snedeker said. “I think there was a time he was so focused on winning  he lost out on the relationships.” During the Wednesday pro-am here  Woods stopped when he came upon a group of military personnel stationed at one hole. He thanked them for their service and added  “Appreciate it.” Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Woods’s comeback is that his performance has everybody looking ahead  not back. “The excitement going into the Masters is going to be massive ” said Adam Scott  the 2013 champion at Augusta National  “because I don’t know if any of us were really thinking Tiger was a true favorite in there  and he might be.” Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/sports/golf/michelle-wie-ana-inspiration.html,Michelle Wie Lays Out a New Goal: ‘Be Free and Have Fun’ Advertisement Supported by On Golf None RANCHO MIRAGE  Calif. — As a carefree 13-year-old  Michelle Wie used the grand stage here in Rancho Mirage to declare her intentions to “go play L.P.G.A. full time and then try to go to the PGA.” It was 2003  and Wie played grown-up golf between giggling discourses on Oreo cookies and Krispy Kreme doughnuts. Wie  28  will make her 14th start at Mission Hills Country Club this week in the ANA Inspiration  the women’s first major of the year. Her performance now  she said  is fueled by avocado toast. Her appearance in the tournament has always been marked by boundless public curiosity and burdensome expectations. But never before has Wie arrived at this point of the season with an L.P.G.A. victory already in her pocket. None “I look forward to this event every year ” she said Tuesday  as she prepared to seek her second major championship. In contrast with her demeanor in recent years  Wie exuded a peaceful  easy feeling during her media availability  punctuating many of her answers with a laughter that called to mind the buoyant teen that she was before the game crippled her body and crushed her confidence. She ultimately played in eight events on the PGA Tour  and made the cut in a men’s tournament on the Asian Tour. Wie has not crossed over since 2008  the year before she became a full-fledged member of the L.P.G.A. tour and won her first tournament. By most estimations  that victory was long overdue  and Wie’s career had been undermined by overreach. None Wie still competes occasionally with men  but only informally and when she is home in Jupiter  Fla. She practices alongside the likes of Justin Thomas and Rickie Fowler  whose fearlessness in attacking the course has helped her reconnect with her younger  undaunted self. “I think a lot on the golf course  I worry about the outcome ” Wie said. “The guys  they care  obviously  but they are a lot more aggressive. I’ve talked to a couple of them  and they said  ‘If it goes in the hazard  it goes in the hazard.’” They approach golf “more like a game ” she said. With her booming drives and towering goals  the teenage Wie attracted a huge following — and a sizable endorsement portfolio after she turned professional  just days before her 16th birthday. She was projected as the Tiger Woods of women’s golf  the transcendent talent who would transform the game  and she struggled under the weight of those expectations. The joy with which she approached the sport dissipated over time  giving way to a world-weary drudgery. “I’ve always been an over-thinker ” Wie said  adding that as a youngster she “just masked it well.” The road to adulthood can be rough for any adolescent  but especially one negotiating the path with the world watching  and critiquing every step. “We accumulate fear  we accumulate overthinking ” Wie said. “Sometimes you have to knock it back down and just kind of be free and have fun.” As a child  Wie idolized Woods  who is now her neighbor in Jupiter. And like him  she has come to inhabit a body troubled by overuse injuries  exacerbated by forceful golf swings. Since 2014  Wie has struggled with finger  hip  ankle  neck and wrist problems. “Every time we see each other we list off all the things: How’s your ankle  how’s your back  how’s everything?” Wie said  referring to Woods. “It’s a 20-minute conversation  and then we can move on from there.” Wie withdrew from last year’s U.S. Women’s Open early in her second round because of neck pain. She played in three more tournaments in July and August before taking all of September off to allow her body time to heal. When she returned  it was with a new outlook  and a new look. Driven by boredom  Wie said with a laugh  she cut her long black hair and became a platinum blonde. One of Wie’s cohorts  Brittany Lincicome  barely recognized her at a tournament this year — because her game had changed quite a bit  too. “In the past  you would wait until the explosion happened or she would hit it out of play or do something really bad and make a really big number ” said Lincicome  who played in a group with Wie. “But this last time I played with her  every shot was down the middle. She was in play every time.” Her accuracy off the tee wasn’t the only part of Wie’s game that impressed Lincicome  one of the tour’s longer drivers. “Her putting is fantastic ” she said. “I told her when we played a couple weeks ago I wanted her as my Solheim partner  because she literally from 20  15 feet  was making every single thing ” Lincicome added  referring to the biennial team event between players from Europe and the United States. “I was like  ‘I’ll drive it  you putt it  and we’ll win.” None Wie said her injuries  strangely  had helped make her a better putter. To stay healthy  she has scaled back her range sessions. “I’m trying not to hit golf balls ” Wie said  adding  “I love to grind  so I focus all of my energy on the putting green.” Wie is no longer chasing history. She’s in no rush to solidify her legacy. “My main focus is staying healthy ” she said  “and we’ll just take it on from there.” None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/sports/golf/jordan-spieth-misses-a-victory-but-gains-another-masters-memory.html,Jordan Spieth Misses a Victory  but Gains Another Masters Memory Advertisement Supported by On Golf None AUGUSTA  Ga. — When Jordan Spieth’s birdie putt on the 16th green dropped into the hole just after 5:40 p.m. on another stirring Masters Sunday  Spieth had made up the nine strokes that formed the gap between him and Patrick Reed at the beginning of the day. At that moment  any number of stunning outcomes were possible for Spieth over the next hour. The Augusta National course record was in reach. So was the record for the biggest final-round comeback in Masters history. And  oh yes  Spieth could have won his second Masters and his fourth major championship  all three months before his 25th birthday. But as the ball disappeared into the cup at No. 16 and the gallery erupted with an ovation that shook a sturdy grandstand  Spieth did not react. There was no celebration  not even a smile. At last  he turned to his caddie  Michael Greller  and said  “Are you kidding me?” Throughout a worldwide golf community that is drawn annually to the final two hours of the Masters tournament precisely because it produces examples of unmatched drama like Spieth’s rousing charge  there must have been a lot of people with the same notion on their lips. Are you kidding me? And while Spieth did not set any records and he finished in third place  two strokes behind Reed  he nonetheless created another indelible Masters memory  something he has done in each of the last five Aprils as a perennial contender here. One takeaway from the 2018 Masters might be this: Golf fans might as well get used to Spieth as a dominant story line at Augusta National’s famed competition for a green jacket. Since 2014  Spieth has always seemed to be the one to watch — even when he has begun the day as an afterthought  as on Sunday. All eyes did not turn to him immediately. The attention was on the final-group pairing of Reed and Rory McIlroy  whose Masters aspirations fizzled yet again. But Spieth began his day with birdies on the first and second holes. Then he birdied the fifth  eighth and ninth holes  capping a torrid opening nine-hole score of five-under-par 31. Spieth was still four strokes behind Reed  who did not appear rattled. But perhaps because he is neither physically imposing nor long off the tee  Spieth attracts a fervent following in nearly every golf circle. And on Sunday  on the hills and hollows of Augusta National  the galleries began to relocate  quick-stepping so they could watch Spieth perform in Amen Corner. He came to the devilish par-3 12th hole  where he lost a late Masters lead in 2016 when he splashed two balls in the water  and shaped a steady tee shot close enough to knock in another birdie putt. “I felt the crowd right then ” Spieth said. “I knew my history on that hole and they did  too. I started to think maybe something good was happening.” But he refused to glance at any of the mammoth leaderboards on the golf course. “I didn’t care ” Spieth said. “Things were working the way I was doing it. I wasn’t going to change anything.” It’s something of a superstition. “He never looks at the scoreboard ” said Justin Thomas  his longtime friend and his playing partner on Sunday. “But I was watching. I knew I couldn’t win so I was rooting for him.” Two birdies followed on the 13th and 15th holes  both par 5s. Spieth sank a scary four-foot downhill putt to secure the birdie on No. 15  and with a thunderous cheer filling his ears  he pumped his right fist five times as he walked off the green toward the 16th tee. Spieth was disappointed by the 16th tee shot  and with good reason. It stopped 33 feet below the hole. But the ensuing stroke appeared destined to find the hole the instant it left Spieth’s putter  tumbling out of view and into the cup. Said Thomas: “I had goose bumps on my arms.” The tie for the lead lasted only about 15 minutes  because Reed was not retreating. He regained a one-stroke lead. As Spieth approached the last hole  he needed a birdie or at least a par to keep the pressure on Reed. Spieth’s final drive of the day just nicked a tree limb jutting into the narrow tunnellike opening off the 18th tee  and the ball ricocheted straight down  about 350 yards from the green. “Not a real bad shot  just hit that little branch ” Spieth said later. Spieth scrambled to give himself a makable par putt  but the round’s magical air had an expiration date. In the last second of Spieth’s round  his par putt drifted off the hole. Walking toward the clubhouse as the fans around the 18th green stood and applauded  Spieth finally spun his head back toward the scoreboard. “I was feeling pretty gutted at the finish ” Spieth said. “I was disappointed by the last part. But truthfully  I began so far back.” As it turned out  Reed did not flinch in his Masters crucible moment as he negotiated the final hole with a steely poise to seal a one-stroke victory over Rickie Fowler. Standing beside the Augusta National clubhouse here late Sunday evening  Spieth could see workers setting up chairs and a lectern for the ceremony that would end with Reed wearing the distinctive green jacket. Spieth had been the centerpiece of a similar celebration three years ago. In 2014  he had been a 20-year-old Masters rookie who completed the tournament in a tie for second. In two other years  he had finished second again and contended late into the final day before slipping into a tie for 11th. Looking across at the preparations for the green jacket presentation as the sun began to set Sunday  Spieth looked very comfortable. He smiled. “To have a chance to have won the last five Masters is pretty cool ” he said. “And that’s what I’m going to take away from today. There will be other years.” None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/sports/golf/tiger-woods-masters.html,Tiger Woods Is More Dogged Than Dazzling in His Return to the Masters Advertisement Supported by On Golf None None In his previous 78 trips around Augusta National  Woods had played the course’s four longest holes in 150 strokes under par. On Thursday  he covered those par 5s in even par. It was only the fifth time in 21 Masters starts that Woods had failed to birdie at least one of those holes. Woods’s round  his first at the Masters since 2015  was a clinic in grit. It took his followers on a roller-coaster ride that ended in a one-over 73 and treated them to Woods at his most dogged. Woods refused to let himself unravel. Not on the first hole  where he salvaged par after pulling his drive into the trees and hitting his approach short of the green. And not on the holes of Amen Corner  where his wayward shots splashed in water  caromed off a patron and parted the gallery. At the par-4 11th  where the fabled corner starts  Woods’s drive sailed right  his low second shot smacked a member of the gallery and landed in the rough  his chip stopped 20 feet from the hole  and his par putt missed. At the par-3 12th  Woods’s tee shot landed in Rae’s Creek. After he pitched to 18 feet  Woods made the bogey putt. After another errant drive on the par-5 13th  Woods hit another low shot that scattered the patrons  he pitched to 16 feet and narrowly missed a birdie attempt. At that point  Woods was three over par and seven strokes behind the early pacesetter  Marc Leishman  who was part of his group. (Tommy Fleetwood rounded out the threesome). But Woods  digging deep  then birdied two of his final five holes. “I could have easily let the round slip away from me  but I got it back ” Woods said. That was more than the defending champion Sergio García could say after a meltdown on the par-5 15th cost him any realistic chance of surviving the cut. It was the same hole where he carded an eagle 3 in his final round last year  but this time García posted a 13  with five water balls  on his way to an 81. Woods has played the 15th hole 79 times since his first Masters appearance in 1995  and his worst score was a triple bogey 8. He has a knack for wielding his wedges and putter like tourniquets when he needs to stop the bleeding. “I don’t like dropping shots because then I have to get it back ” Woods said. Woods’s return to the Masters after a two-year absence due to multiple spinal operations was well received by the fans  who gave him a standing ovation when he appeared on the range for his warm-up session. “The crowds have been incredible ” Woods said  adding  “They’re really into it.” It was easy to get swept up in the hype that heralded Woods’s first appearance in a major since he missed the cut at the 2015 P.G.A. Championship. At his pretournament news conference this week  Woods was asked if it would qualify as “the greatest sporting comeback of all time” if  at the tournament’s end  he was wearing his fifth Masters jacket. “Let’s just kind of slow down ” said Woods  providing the necessary dose of perspective. If he were to win this tournament  he said  it wouldn’t even qualify as the greatest comeback of all time in golf. Woods mentioned Ben Hogan  who in 1949 was driving a car that collided head-on with a Greyhound bus. Hogan’s left leg was mangled. He sustained fractures in his left collarbone  left ankle  pelvis and a rib. He developed blood clots. After being sidelined for a little more than a year  Hogan returned at age 37 and won the last six of his nine majors  including two Masters. “I mean  he got hit by a bus and came back and won major championships ” Woods said  insisting that Hogan’s comeback qualified as the greatest in sports because of “the pain he had to endure  the things he had to do just to play  the wrapping of the leg  all the hot tubs  and just how hard it was for him to walk  period.” Jack Burke Jr.  the 1956 Masters champion  was competing when Hogan returned. Now 95  Burke watched the telecast of Thursday’s round from the Champions Golf Club in Houston  which he helped start. When Hogan returned  Burke said  there much less fanfare. “The tour didn’t have the reputation that it does now because of television ” he said. “He came back  and it was like nobody knew he had been gone.” Burke said he wouldn’t be surprised if Woods is successful in his comeback. “It’s like being governor and coming back to be governor again ” he said. Woods was certainly not the governor on Thursday  but he didn’t take himself out of the running  either. “I’m right back in this tournament ” he said.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/sports/golf/masters-tiger-woods-phil-mickelson.html,Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson Warm Up Together  and to Each Other Advertisement Supported by On Golf None None Yes  it was hardly practice as usual at Augusta National when Mickelson and Woods  the game’s great rivals who had circled each other like birds of prey for more than two decades  played nine holes together ahead of a major for the first time in their storied careers. It was Mickelson’s idea  and Woods embraced it. “We enjoyed it ” Woods said. This very public thawing of their relationship proved an irresistible attraction at Augusta National  where  strangely  birdsong is heard but birds are rarely seen. That’s what made the sight at the 13th hole doubly surreal. As Mickelson and Woods were playing the 510-yard par 5  a large crane strutted across the fairway. The crane joined the huge gallery in time to see Woods hit his second shot to within 40 feet of the pin. The roar after Woods stepped up and sank the eagle putt was deafening. The crowd erupted again after he made a much shorter attempt for another eagle at 15. When the noise quieted to a loud murmur  one patron remarked  “It sounds like Sunday and it’s only a practice round.” Mickelson and Woods beat the other half of the foursome  Fred Couples  the 1992 Masters champion  and the Belgian Thomas Pieters  in a contest that wasn’t close. “It was very loud and very fun and they hit some real good shots ” Couples said. “Wow.” Mickelson wore a long-sleeved  button-down shirt that inspired a joke from his playing partner. “The only thing that was missing was a tie ” Woods said. Woods has gotten the better of Mickelson on the course many more times than not  but according to their peers  it is a tossup as to who is ahead in the war of wit. “It’s pretty even ” said Jordan Spieth  who has heard them up close at Ryder Cups and Presidents Cups. He added  “Tiger has more accolades than just about anybody in the sport — you know  nobody wants to go out there and just say  ‘I’ve won this or this or this or this ’ and Phil’s kind of better at getting under people’s skin.” Woods  42  is an introverted only child. Mickelson  five years his senior  is an extroverted firstborn with two siblings. The one important thing they have in common — a burning desire to win — is probably the primary factor behind their lack of closeness all these years. Remember: Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer became fast friends only after they stopped banging heads on the golf course. “Oh  man  he’s very  very  competitive ” Woods said of Mickelson. “He’s feisty. He’s determined. He always wants to win.” Woods  of course  could have been describing the man in the mirror. Justin Thomas  whom Woods mentored while on the mend from multiple back surgeries  played a practice round with him on Monday. Thomas noted a change in Woods’s demeanor as they prepared to compete with each other. Woods  he said  was “a little harder to get stuff out of than when he was hurt and I was asking him questions.” Mickelson has tour victories in four decades  but younger players like Thomas  the reigning P.G.A. champion  almost universally looked up to Woods when they were growing up. “He was winning about every other tournament he played in ” Thomas explained. In some ways  though  Mickelson had the more auspicious start to his career  winning his first PGA Tour title when he was still an amateur. He has won 43 Tour titles  including five majors  while Woods has 79 tour wins  including 14 majors. If Mickelson hadn’t played in the same era as Woods  he might have “10 to 12 majors ” Couples said. Mickelson isn’t so sure. “It’s very possible that that’s the case ” he said  “and it’s also possible that he brought out the best in me and forced me to work harder and focus to ultimately achieve the success that I’ve had.” Six golfers in their 40s have won a Masters title. Led by Mickelson and Woods  at least a half-dozen here this week have a chance to become the seventh. The others include the 2007 champion  Zach Johnson  42  Charley Hoffman  41  who led after the first two rounds last year  Paul Casey  40  who has top-six finishes in each of the past three years  and Ian Poulter  42  who secured the final berth with a playoff victory Sunday in Houston. After Mickelson won the World Golf Championships event in Mexico City last month in a playoff against Thomas  Woods described Mickelson’s first victory since 2013 as “very  very cool to watch.” Woods tied for second a week later at the Valspar Championship outside Tampa  and Mickelson said he sent Woods a text message after he played his way into contention. Mickelson said he had told Woods that it felt “like it was a different time continuum  because I found myself pulling so hard for him.” This week they are less rivals than two men united against Father Time  a much more formidable opponent than Couples and Pieters combined. “I find that I want him to play well ” Mickelson said  “and I’m excited to see him play so well.” At the start of the practice round  Woods teed off first. Someone asked how the group had decided who got that honor. An impish smile creased Mickelson’s face. “We just went right in order ” he said. “He has four jackets  I have three jackets  Fred  then Thomas.” Mickelson winked. “It’s a respect thing.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/27/sports/tennis/serena-williams.html,Starring Serena Williams as Herself On Tennis She is newly married  embracing the challenges of motherhood and embarking on a difficult tennis comeback. And her private life is about to become much more transparent with a new documentary series on HBO.  None Supported by None On a gray  gloomy Wednesday in Manhattan  Serena Williams was swaddled in bath towels to stay warm in an air-conditioned corner suite on the 41st floor of the Lotte New York Palace Hotel. The room’s normally panoramic view had been obscured by dense fog  making it a challenge to see even across the street. That seemed an apt metaphor for Williams’s tennis career as she comes back from maternity leave at age 36.  It remains unclear whether she will be able to return to dominance. As she heads to Europe to start her clay-court season  she has played in only two tournaments in 2018  winning two matches and losing two and struggling  understandably  to regain full fitness. But her personal life is a much clearer  blue sky matter. She is newly married to Alexis Ohanian  the internet entrepreneur and co-founder of Reddit  and is embracing the challenges of motherhood with their 8-month-old daughter  Olympia. “We haven’t been apart from each other more than 24 hours  ever ” Williams said of her daughter  whom Williams’s longtime fitness trainer  Mackie Shilstone  calls Baby O. None The cameras follow her and Ohanian through some of the most intimate moments of their lives: even into the delivery room during Olympia’s birth by cesarean section as Ohanian murmurs  “So proud of you ” into his wife’s ear. That is only moments before they get their first look at their new “teammate ” Williams’s splayed fingers mirroring Olympia’s outstretched arms with a clear  plastic barrier still separating mother and child. Olympia is soon placed on Williams’s chest and immediately stops crying. The scene and the series are all the more surprising in light of Williams’s longtime reluctance to share much publicly about her previous relationships  or even acknowledge them. But she is in a new phase  and she reveals herself with few limits: letting the public see her concerns  her fears  her puffy eyes  her extra pounds  her surgical scar and her sense of humor  which is rarely in evidence when she’s in her fist-clenching  turf-defending mode on the tennis court. “A lot of people see me on the court  and they only judge and see that side of me  and there’s so much more to my life and to me ” she told me. “That’s not me  actually to be honest  on the court. As much a part of my life as it is  I become a different person when I play tennis. The second I step onto the facilities  the grounds  I become a different person  and the second I step off  I’m back to being Serena  no pun intended. “So I thought it would be interesting  while we were going through this process  if I just took all the curtains away  and I was just myself.” Williams said she was the one who initiated the process with the HBO series. “It was super-organic ” she said. “When I found out I was pregnant  I was saying  ‘I really want to get some footage of me ’ because I remember my dad had all this film when we were younger  all this cool footage  and I wanted to start this journey for Olympia  even though she was the size of a raspberry at the time.” She shared the thought with her agent  Jill Smoller. “HBO got wind of it  and they said  ‘We would love to do it for you ’ ” Williams said. “My original idea was to do more just Olympia stuff  and then I thought if we’re going to do this  let’s go all out.” None As she and Ohanian arrive at their house in Palm Beach Gardens  Fla.  Williams emerges from the car  struggling to put one foot in front of the other as she lugs Olympia in a baby carrier with her right hand as if nothing — truly nothing — is going to stop her from reaching the front door.  “I didn’t want to let her go  I don’t want to let her go ” Williams explained to me. “I like to believe  and I would like other people to understand  that I’m no different than anyone else. I have the same struggles a lot of women have had  and a lot of women are probably determined to carry their baby in the door. And a lot of women are determined to do a lot of the stuff that I do  and there’s literally no difference between me and them with the exception of the side of me that just so happens to play professional tennis.” None That trophy now sits on a small shelf in Olympia’s room. “It was definitely my idea because I feel like it’s hers ” Williams said. “It’s sitting in her bedroom  and one day she will understand it  and I hope if we are fortunate enough to have more kids that they won’t be jealous.” During the HBO series  when Ohanian repositions the trophy as the couple prepares for Olympia’s birth  Williams chides him: “Lex  don’t break it. You’ll never have one.” After the delivery  as Williams lies in a hospital bed applying makeup and looking into a hand-held mirror  Ohanian asks  “What did you say when someone said that our little girl was going to win Wimbledon in like 15  20 years?” Williams  as if on cue  puts the mirror aside and answers  “Not if I’m still on tour!” to which a deeply amused Ohanian responds  “You’re ridiculous.” There is much more of this banter  and at one stage  Williams expresses surprise that she and Ohanian “are such a good fit.” “I’m an athlete ” she says. “He’s a business guy. I’m black. He’s white. We are totally opposite. I think we just complement each other. I think we understand hard work in different ways.” Anyone who has read Richard Williams’s 2014 memoir  “Black and White: The Way I See It ” knows how much resentment he felt about the racism he faced growing up in the American South and how intent he was on preparing his tennis-playing daughters to handle being outsiders in a predominantly white sport. Racist comments that he said he heard at the tournament in Indian Wells  Calif.  in 2001 were a big part of the reason Serena and Venus Williams boycotted the event for more than a decade. I asked Serena  who had dated black men and white men  what message her marriage to Ohanian sent. “Oh my God ” she said. “Literally all I tell Alexis is  ‘well  you know  there’s such a difference between white people and black people.’ He always gets to hear about the injustices that happen  that wouldn’t happen if I were white. It’s interesting. I never thought I would have married a white guy  either  so it just goes to show you that love truly has no color  and it just really goes to show me the importance of what love is. And my dad absolutely loves Alexis.” She added: “Ultimately I wanted to be with someone who treated me nice  someone who was able to laugh with me and someone who understood my life and someone that loved me. “And you know  I’m sure there’s other people out there ” she said  pausing for effect and then laughing. “But you know  Alexis is the one I connected with  and I wouldn’t have it any other way.” In the series  as they finally settle into the front seat of their car to leave the hospital  she turns to Ohanian and says  a bit groggily  “I think we should have another baby ” to which Ohanian responds — all too aware of what they went through in the previous days — “Can we at least get home with the first one?” Williams told me she did not remember her comment until she saw the video. “I must have been crazy ” she said  laughing. “I was clearly on something.” But she acknowledges  nearly eight months later  that the desire remains strong. “Oh yeah  if I wasn’t wanting to play tennis ” she said  “I definitely would have talked Alexis into having a baby already.” None “I played … obscenity ” she said  pausing and managing to avoid the four-letter option.  “So I just thought after match point  I just thought there’s no need ” she added  referring to the news conference. “Such an easy shot  and I think I almost hit someone in the stands.” At the memory  Williams started to laugh uproariously  the sound reverberating through the suite. “And the best part was I passed Venus  and Venus looked at me and said  “I get it  oh  I get it ’” she said. Venus also has declined to speak with the news media on some occasions after painful early-round losses  but Serena  like her big sister  is intent on using the setback for fuel. “I feel like I set my expectations incredibly high  and I feel like after Miami  I wanted to get more  not realistic expectations  but more reasonable expectations for me ” Serena Williams said. “And so took some time off and then started training like a lot  lot  lot  lot  lot  lot  lot  lot  lot  lot.” Williams’s eyes darted back and forth with each “lot” as if she were watching a long baseline rally. Shilstone  her trainer  said he told her after Miami: “Serena  you know how to play tennis. You are just not fit.” More than five weeks after the Osaka defeat  Shilstone said  Williams’s fitness level is back up to “about 75 percent” of what it was when she won the 2017 Australian Open. “Let me tell you  yesterday over at the hotel  we just did over 500 repetitions on the whole body with cords and cables ” he said. “It was unbelievable  500  and we did it in 45 minutes. Serena says: ‘Mackie  now that I have a baby  I can’t go two hours or whatever. We’ve got to get it done quick.’ And I said  ‘No  we’ve got to get it done smart.’ ” Williams has a full-time nanny and is getting considerable child-care help from her mother  Oracene Price. But like many a working parent  Williams said she would like to clone herself  except that at this stage she would need “a clone army” because of her increasingly dense mix of business interests outside tennis. She and Olympia will soon head to France  where Williams will train at her coach Patrick Mouratoglou’s academy near Nice. She said she was not yet certain to play in the WTA Premier Mandatory event in Madrid  which begins on May 5  but is “definitely” playing in Rome the following week and at the French Open  which would be her first Grand Slam tournament since her comeback began. “I feel like since Miami  I’ve made a ton of progress  but who knows ” she said. “I’ll have to see when I get out there to play a match. I always have to be ready  but I have to be even more ready because who knows who I can play early  or first or second. So I really have to be super-super-ready  so that’s kind of what I’ve been working on.” Williams has a protected ranking of No. 1 that guarantees her entry into tournaments. But just like players returning from long-term injuries  she does not have a protected seeding that would help her avoid playing high-ranked players in early rounds. There has been a push within the WTA to reconsider that rule for players returning from pregnancy. Williams is in favor of protected seedings  arguing that women should not be discouraged from having families during their playing careers. “I think it’s more of a protection for women to have a life ” Williams said. “You shouldn’t have to wait to have a baby until you retire. If you want to have a baby and take a few months off or a year off and then come back  you shouldn’t have to be penalized for that. Pregnancy is not an injury.” It certainly has cost Williams physically  though. She calls this comeback “the biggest challenge” of her career.  “I never felt winded like that ” she said of her early practice sessions. “And it felt like no matter what I do  the weight is taking forever to get off  and it was crazy. Finally I was able to get better  but it took forever.” Ion Tiriac  the owner of the Madrid tournament  where Williams is likely to play next  referred to her weight when asked about Williams and the state of the women’s game in a recent interview with Sport Bild  a German publication.  “With all due respect  36 years old and 90 kilograms ” or 198 pounds  Tiriac said  adding that he wished women’s tennis had more headliners. “I always say people are entitled to their opinion ” said Williams  a two-time champion in Madrid  after being informed of the comment. “Clearly there’s more to women’s tennis than me. There’s a lot more  but I’ll have words with him  believe me  I’ll have words with him. It’s an ignorant comment  and it’s a sexist comment  and maybe he’s an ignorant man.”  None “Apparently 10 percent of women get it ” Serena Williams said. “So you have to continue to pump and feed until it clears. I’m finally ready to stop a little bit mentally  but it’s definitely going to be hard.” Consider that yet another challenge for Williams  who has been through so many of them in her 23-year professional career and yet still claims to thrive on them. She maintains that next season  not this season  will be the right time to judge where her tennis truly is. Whenever the end of her career comes  she wants a big-bang finish. “Eventually I’m going to have to drop that mic  and I would like for it to be a mic drop moment ” she said. Winning the 2017 Australian Open with Olympia along for the ride would  of course  have been an excellent one. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/sports/tennis/davis-cup.html,A Davis Cup Overhaul and a World Team Cup Revival Add Up to Tennis Excess Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None INDIAN WELLS  Calif. — With an overstuffed calendar and heavyweight competition from other global sports  the last thing professional tennis needs is two similar men’s team events within a few weeks of each other. “Agreed ” said David Haggerty  the president of the International Tennis Federation. Yet there have been indications here in Indian Wells and elsewhere that this is exactly where this great but too-often divided game is heading. Surely not even tennis can be this clueless. But big money and the survival instinct are powerful forces. Both are in play when it comes to the Davis Cup and the would-be World Team Cup. The Davis Cup  the premier men’s team competition since it was founded in 1900  is owned and operated by the International Tennis Federation  which depends on the event for much of its annual income. Under pressure from sponsors and disgruntled top players  the I.T.F. has proposed a drastically new and reduced format in a 25-year  purportedly $3 billion partnership with the investment group Kosmos. The plan is to create a one-week event involving 18 teams at the end of the season  in late November or early December. If approved by the I.T.F. member nations later this year  the new version of the Davis Cup would begin in 2019. The World Team Cup was routinely staged in Düsseldorf  Germany  in May before being discontinued in 2012. It was diverting but never considered the premier team test. Now the leadership of the men’s tour  the ATP  is looking to revive it on a grander and more lucrative scale in cooperation with Tennis Australia. It would place this one- or two-week event at the start of the season in early January as part of the lead-up to the Australian Open. If approved by the ATP leadership  the new-age World Team Cup could begin in 2020. “The Davis Cup has over a hundred years of history  and the I.T.F. are clearly looking to evolve the competition in an attempt to maximize its potential ” the ATP executive chairman  Chris Kermode  said in an email. “The results of those efforts remain to be seen. Our focus remains on bringing the ATP World Team Cup back into the calendar  an exciting project which we’ve been working on for over 18 months now  with the last few details still to be finalized.” The idea appears to be to use an Australian city like Brisbane  which has an ATP event for now  as the site of the new event. “We believe we have a strong option in partnership with Tennis Australia in Week 1 of the calendar  utilizing locations which are known to showcase the sport in a very positive way ” Kermode said. “It’s an option that would cause minimal disruption to existing player scheduling given that the vast majority of players are playing that week already in the Southern Hemisphere.” Something clearly has to give  and though Haggerty and Kermode met at Indian Wells last week and agreed to keep each other informed  nothing has given yet. “They will compete  but one’s going to end up swallowing the other eventually ” Milos Raonic  the Canadian star  said of the two events. “Because I don’t think in any sport  two team competitions  other than something as big as soccer  really survive.” None “We take three days out of the year  so don’t worry about us ” Federer said on Wednesday after advancing to the quarterfinals in Indian Wells. “I think it’s a great event. I think the players really enjoyed themselves. I hope it’s going to be forever successful. We have no guarantee  like no tournament really has  except maybe Wimbledon  to be honest.” To be just as honest  who knows where sports or grass-court tennis will find themselves on the popularity charts in 100 years? But what is clear is that in the much shorter term  it is pure folly to create a glut of men’s team tennis events that will only end up diluting the interest in all of them. “The fans aren’t going to understand ” said Jeremy Chardy  a veteran French player. “It would seem bizarre to have essentially the same thing twice in a row.” This would-be turf war is nothing new: In the 1990s  the I.T.F. backed the creation of an end-of-the-year individual tournament called the Grand Slam Cup  which came after the ATP’s tour finals. The Grand Slam Cup  open to the most successful players in the year’s four major tournaments  offered huge money for the time — $2 million to the winner — but no ranking points without ATP support. It lasted until 1999 before reason (and economics) prevailed  and the two events essentially merged. Why go through it all again? The current conflict also seems like a late-in-the-game scramble to capitalize on the golden era of Federer  Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic before it starts to fade to sepia  which could be very soon. What the sport really needs for the long term is one  just one  clearly defined and fully supported team event  preferably not an annual one. In an ideal world  it would include the women. Combined events  including the Grand Slams  are among tennis’s greatest strengths going forward  with women’s sports set to take on greater importance and market share. A combined team event of true import — not the low-key Hopman Cup in Perth  Australia — would set tennis apart from all the other sports that stage their World Cups for men and women separately. Badminton already has proved that the combined model works by bringing men’s and women’s national teams together with its biennial Thomas & Uber Cup  which will be in Bangkok in May. But even a single men’s team event is looking like a pipe dream for tennis at the moment. Part of the problem is that the Kosmos group was deeply involved in negotiations with Kermode and the ATP to revive the World Team Cup before running into resistance from ATP board members representing the tournaments. Kosmos  which is headed by the Barcelona soccer star Gerard Piqué and backed by the Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani  then resumed negotiating with Haggerty after the I.T.F. had rebuffed an initial approach. The bottom line: Kermode  a popular leader so far  is now vulnerable for having let Kosmos get away  and Haggerty and the I.T.F. are now vulnerable because their organization’s cash cow  the Davis Cup  is steadily fading as the major stars decline to make it a consistent priority. If the World Team Cup comes into existence  and provides nearly the same prize money as a revamped Davis Cup along with the ranking points that the Davis Cup cannot provide  it is a potential existential threat. That would be true whether or not the Davis Cup adopted a new format. Even if the Davis Cup stays put with four weeks of world group competition spread throughout each season  top players  presented with a less-demanding option to represent their nations annually  would be more likely to choose the path of least resistance. “I don’t know if it would be great to play both competitions in the same year ” said Feliciano López  the 36-year-old Spanish veteran  conceding that “two in five weeks would be too much.” Hear  hear. Clearly  the time for compromise and vision is now. Unfortunately  pro tennis’s numerous governing bodies are better at defending their territory than doing what is best for the sport.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/sports/tennis/roger-federer-laver-cup-chicago.html,A Day With Roger Federer: A Tennis Ambassador’s Work Is Never Done Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None CHICAGO — Day was breaking in the California desert  and Roger Federer was yawning on the tarmac. How much sleep? “Five hours ” he said. “Not enough after a match like that.” None “It’s always disappointing when you lose having had match points ” Federer said. “I think I was a bit lucky to even get into a third set  and he was a bit lucky to get to the tiebreak and finish it off. Sadly  I lost my game a bit at the end.” But that was Sunday afternoon. This was Monday morning  early Monday morning  and Federer was back on the move: arriving at sunrise at the Jacqueline Cochran Regional Airport in Thermal  a short drive from Indian Wells. Along for the ride were Tony Godsick  his agent  Alessandro Sant’Albano  Godsick’s associate  and Severin Luethi  Federer’s coach  who looked even sleepier than Federer. None This was a long-planned detour  but it also ended up serving as a way to quickly change the chip after the final in Indian Wells  Federer’s first loss in 2018. “Roger’s life  if it’s not hectic  it’s not Roger’s life  because it’s all he knows ” Godsick said. None But today is about business  and Federer  back at No. 1 at age 36  is clearly pushing himself to make it happen after back-to-back three-set matches on Saturday and Sunday. “It’s passion and a love for the game ” Federer said. “And Laver Cup is something that is very dear to me  so clearly I always have extra energy for the Laver Cup. For my own career  I don’t play as much anymore  and when I am there  it’s all out and full speed  and then I need the time away again.” After takeoff at 7 a.m.  there was no shortage of legroom or long yawns. There was an unsuccessful attempt at a nap in his chair  a modest shared breakfast (burritos  steel-cut oatmeal and juice) and plenty of chatter about this being Federer’s first trip to Chicago. He then went into a separate cabin at 8:30 a.m.  closed the drapes and took a 45-minute official nap that may or may not have included actual napping. “He would have been up early anyway today because he’s got four kids  and they are still adjusting from European time ” Godsick said. “He also had to get to Miami. We spend a lot of time maximizing time  because he doesn’t have that much time. This is a four-hour detour. There are worse things to do  but sure it’s hard.” As the plane approached Midway International Airport after about three hours in the air  Federer warmed up for chilly Chicago with a quick quiz. N.F.L. team? “Bears ” he answered. N.H.L. team? “Blackhawks.” Baseball team? “Cubs.” And? “White Sox ” he said triumphantly after a pause  dragging out the vowels in his best American accent. There was no need to test him on the N.B.A. Federer has been an N.B.A. fan since boyhood and was 16 when Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen won their last title with the Bulls in 1998. A visit to United Center  the home arena of the Bulls and the Blackhawks and the site of the Laver Cup in September  was a big part of Monday’s dense itinerary  which was focused on building interest for the event and creating social-media content. Federer walked down the plane’s stairway shortly after 1 p.m. Chicago time after selecting a fresh set of clothes. He was soon at a deep-dish pizza parlor downtown for a photo op with the 79-year-old Rod Laver  John McEnroe and the Australian star Nick Kyrgios. A former No. 1-ranked player  McEnroe still wears many a tennis hat and is the captain of the Laver Cup’s Team World  which lost to Federer  Rafael Nadal and Team Europe in last year’s inaugural edition. Kyrgios  22  was one of the most enthusiastic members of McEnroe’s team in Prague  leading the cheers and nearly defeating Federer in the final and decisive match of the competition. “The funnest week of my career so far  better than the Grand Slams ” said Kyrgios  who for all his evident talent has yet to get past the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament. None After proving Laver Cup could be done  Godsick and Federer now must prove it can be sustained  both economically and competitively  in a sport with a full calendar. Any new event that lacks ranking points and mandatory participation is vulnerable to irrelevance. With Federer still near the peak of his powers  Chicago should be a success  and Godsick expects to sell out United Center for all three days of competition. Rahm Emanuel  the Chicago mayor  was part of the push to secure the event for the city  which has long been without a men’s or women’s main tour event. Emanuel joined Federer and the others on Monday at a news conference. There were also cameo appearances from Pippen and the German soccer star Bastian Schweinsteiger. Schweinsteiger plays for the Chicago Fire of M.L.S. and became a parent last week with his wife  the retired tennis player Ana Ivanovic. Pippen  52  served as chief tour guide for Federer and Co. as they visited the Bulls’ and the Blackhawks’ locker rooms and the statues of Pippen and Jordan at United Center. Federer said he got goose bumps when he met Pippen and got a few more chills as he walked into the arena for the first time  though not because of the sheet of ice still in place after Sunday night’s N.H.L. game. “It’s like a multiple layer cake ” Federer said after gazing up and up. “In Europe  we don’t have those very often  where you have suites and another layer and another layer. Usually it stops after two or three  but here it keeps going. I think it’s going to be epic.” The Laver Cup’s epicness will be determined in large part by who actually decides to play. The competition comes less than two weeks after the United States Open. Might some European and Asian stars — some of whom  like Hyeon Chung of South Korea  are represented by IMG — choose to save their energy for other late-season events? “I think that’s going to always be an open question a little bit ” Federer said. “I hope it’s not going to happen. I hope by showcasing and giving them such an amazing platform and being part of something quite unique  being on a team together  that they would not want to miss it. There comes a bit of sacrifice with doing something like this.” The Laver Cup offers prize money to the winning team and sizable participation fees on a graduated scale. Team8 has arranged for private-jet travel to and from Europe to encourage European players like Nadal and Alexander Zverev to play again and others  Novak Djokovic in particular  to play for the first time. Djokovic and Andy Murray  both injured last year  did not take part  and it is unclear whether they would have done so anyway. Federer  meanwhile  continues to fly improbably high as the oldest No. 1 in ATP history. How long can he defy gravity? “When I started with him  I made many more predictions than I do now  and I was very often wrong ” Luethi said. “I am ready to be surprised by him. I’m actually expecting to be surprised by him  and I think the best thing is to leave it open and not try to put fences around it.” For Federer  who will most likely skip the clay-court season for a second straight year  the key is internal at this stage. “When you go to  say  Rotterdam  you need to go there with fire ” he said. “If you’re not excited at this age  don’t do it. It’s that simple.” Creating and playing in the Laver Cup  his potential legacy event  has helped feed the fire. But then  so has his personality: extroverted and still curious about new people and new experiences. “Think about today ” he said on his way back to Midway Airport. “We left with the sunrise  beautiful weather in Indian Wells  and we get here and it’s cold and a totally different vibe. That’s the beauty of travel  of seeing different places. I love it. I do. I still love it.” With that  he was soon successfully fighting the Chicago wind to open the car door and heading up the stairway. Last stop on this genuinely manic Monday: Miami.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/sports/tennis/indian-wells-daria-kasatkina.html,Daria Kasatkina Is Building Up to a Tennis Masterpiece Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None INDIAN WELLS  Calif. — Philippe Dehaes  Daria Kasatkina’s new and understandably delighted coach  was swinging an imaginary tennis racket in the players lounge late Tuesday night. He was showing me what he wants her to avoid: a typical tennis player’s ideal hitting zone  which is mid-hip to just below the shoulder. “Dasha can decide ” he said  using Kasatkina’s nickname. “She can put the ball high  low  slow  short  whatever she wants  but she cannot hit the ball to those girls so they can hit it here.” None But an antidote appears to be brewing  and Kasatkina  a 20-year-old Russian  is a big part of the mix. She does have power  as anyone who has watched her rip a topspin forehand can attest. But she also has a wide array of solutions and strokes  including wicked drop shots  and a gift for rhythm shifts that borders on the musical. She is in the midst of a hot streak and in the quarterfinals of the BNP Paribas Open after consecutive victories over Sloane Stephens and Caroline Wozniacki  who happen to be the last two women to win Grand Slam singles titles. None “She outsmarted me today  which is fair enough ” the second-seeded Wozniacki said on Tuesday. She is hardly alone. Kasatkina also beat Ostapenko in the third round of last year’s United States Open and defeated Garbiñe Muguruza  the 2017 Wimbledon champion  on her way to the final in Dubai last month. That means that since September  Kasatkina has beaten all four reigning major champions. She also beat Halep  now the world No. 1  in Wuhan  China  last fall. “In the beginning it was really tough because I was really nervous going on the big stages  on the big courts against the big players ” Kasatkina said. “But now with experience  with the time  I’m getting into it.” Next week  Kasatkina is set to become the highest-ranked Russian for the first time  at around No. 15. She is currently ranked 19th  one spot behind Svetlana Kuznetsova  and could break into the top 10 if she defeats Angelique Kerber  another former No. 1  in the quarterfinals Thursday and goes on to win the title here. Insiders already know Kasatkina is a big-time talent  but outsiders will soon figure out that she is an entertainer as well. “I think when people will see her regularly in the Grand Slams  they are really going to gravitate to her because her game is really atypical ” Dehaes said. “She likes the show. She likes the jump backhands  the drop shots. She plays this way naturally  but it’s festive tennis. I insist on leaving her a lot of freedom when she plays  but she has to create  has to make things happen  really like an artist. I compared it to an empty canvas a few days ago  and I said she can make whatever art on that canvas that she wants as long as it’s beautiful.” If you have access to all the colors  it seems a pity not to make use of as many of them as you can. “Exactly ” he said. “That’s exactly the image.” Dehaes  a Belgian  became Kasatkina’s full-time coach late last year after she split with Vladimir Platenik  a Slovakian who coached her for three seasons. Dehaes has worked with a string of prominent Belgian players  including Kristof Vliegen  Xavier Malisse and Christophe Rochus. Dehaes first saw Kasatkina in December 2013  when she came to Belgium seeking financial backing from a foundation. “She had no money  nothing to finance her training ” he said. “I coached a girl  Maryna Zanevska  who was getting help from this foundation  and so the people in the foundation asked me to give them a report on Daria’s abilities.” After testing her for two weeks  Dehaes submitted his report: “I said that I had never seen a talent like Daria. Really incredible  and it’s being confirmed now.” He said what persuaded him was her performance in a Belgian tournament during that two-week testing period. “The best girls were around 500 in WTA  so it was a good national competition ” Dehaes said. “And during this competition there were three or four people watching her to see if she had the ability to receive financing  and for a kid who is 14 or 15  that is incredible pressure. And she won the tournament with such maturity and self-assurance that I said to myself  ‘Here we have someone special.’” Though the foundation was unable to reach agreement with Kasatkina and her family  Dehaes said he kept close track of her in the coming years as she won the 2014 French Open junior title and broke into the top 100. Since joining forces  they have clicked quickly and had many extended conversations  even on changeovers. In Dubai  during her three-set victory over Johanna Konta in the round of 16  Dehaes gave Kasatkina an extended pep talk in which he urged her to stay the course. “The weather is beautiful  it’s full of people ” he said. “Let’s stay for two more hours.” Kasatkina said her new coach had helped her confidence  pounding the table on Tuesday as she described his upbeat message. But Dehaes said he was happy that she had not called him on court during the Stephens and Wozniacki matches. “I’m super proud of this ” he said. “The main goal for this girl is to win one of the four Grand Slams  and no on-court coaching is allowed at the Grand Slams. So that’s a good sign.” For now  Kasatkina has yet to get past the fourth round at a major  but if she can remain healthy and in form  her game should translate well to clay and the French Open. “For sure with the kick serve  the forehand topspin and the drop shot and slice on clay  she can be magic ” Dehaes said. “But she is very young. She was working before with a coach who was really focused on the opponent and on adapting the game to the opponent. I don’t watch the opponent. I say: ‘Dasha  you have everything in your game to be one of the best girls in the world. You just have to do the right thing at the right moment  perfectly.’” And avoid that danger zone while making art. None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/sports/tennis/serena-williams-australian-open.html,Serena Williams Is Set to Reclaim Her Leading Role in Tennis Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None MELBOURNE  Australia — The 36-year-old tennis superstar with 20 Grand Slam singles titles is ready for some downtime. None None “Serena is a champion ” her coach  Patrick Mouratoglou  said in a recent interview. “When she comes back  she will come back to win.” She has still been present on tour to a degree. “She’s been the best female tennis player ever and of course everybody’s speaking about her even when she is not here ” said Wim Fissette  who coaches Angelique Kerber. With social media  Williams can be as much a part of the daily conversation at a tournament as she likes  and she weighed in on occasion during the Australian Open. None None It is quite a juxtaposition: Federer  the biggest star in men’s tennis  taking a break while Williams  the biggest star in women’s tennis  returns to action. But it underscores how complementary the men’s and women’s games can be  a symbiotic relationship that remains one of the sport’s core strengths. Though there are distinctions  men’s tennis and women’s tennis are viewed as the same product by many who tune in only during the year’s biggest tournaments. Those are nearly all combined men’s and women’s events: from the four Grand Slam tournaments to Indian Wells and Miami. None At the Grand Slams and elsewhere  the women and men can cover for each other. If one singles tournament is pedestrian  the other might sprout wings  and though the men’s game has routinely been must-see in a golden era of rivalries  the women carried the load at this Australian Open. None “The women’s tournament has kicked the tail of the men’s tournament ” Darren Cahill  Halep’s coach  said when asked to compare them. That is not the primary objective  of course. The key point is that together  united and for equal rewards when they share the same stages  women’s tennis and men’s tennis are better off in the long run. Women’s sports are rising  and tennis is already a sport with a relatively even mix of fans of both genders in many markets. Does the men’s tour earn more revenue globally and often attract higher viewership? Absolutely. But does the deep and traditional connection with women’s tennis make the men’s game and the sport as a whole more relevant to today’s and tomorrow’s audiences? None There can be no question that Serena Williams’s return after childbirth is a boost to tennis  period. It is unclear what role she will play in Fed Cup next week. Singles? Doubles with Venus? But even if the rust from her layoff was apparent in Abu Dhabi  her rivals are anticipating excellence when she returns in earnest. “Even a Serena at 80 percent was still better than all the rest when she dominated women’s tennis for so many years ” Fissette said. “From Serena  I only expect the best to be honest  and I believe she will have a good chance of winning a Slam again this year.” Williams will not be seeded when and if she returns. (She is on the entry list for the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells  Calif.  which begins March 5.) Though she can gain entry to tournaments with her protected ranking of No. 1  she has no official ranking after more than a year out of competition. The last time she had no official ranking was in 1997. “Serena not being seeded — well  that’s tough on everybody ” Fissette said. “It’s going to be very interesting to see the draws.” Wozniacki  back at No. 1  playing Williams in her opening round at  say  Indian Wells is not out of the question. “Serena is the benchmark for women’s tennis and has been for the last 10 years ” Cahill said. “The fact she will come back is going to lift everybody’s game. She has everybody’s attention. That has been the case for many years  but the girls have not been twiddling their thumbs while she’s been away.” He added: “For the women’s game  it’s better to have Serena challenging for majors. It’s up to the girls to make it as tough as possible for her.” What Federer made abundantly clear in Melbourne  though  is that being 36 years old is no barrier to winning the biggest titles.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/24/sports/tennis/hyeon-chung-australian-open.html,Hyeon Chung’s Tennis Breakthrough Was Shaped in a Parking Lot Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None MELBOURNE  Australia — Pressure? You think Hyeon Chung playing in his first Grand Slam semifinal at age 21 is pressure? Friday’s match at the Australian Open — Chung’s first against Roger Federer — will certainly be a high-profile one  but through Chung’s lenses  the stakes were much higher in September 2014 when he was competing in men’s doubles at the Asian Games in Incheon  South Korea  in his home country. Win the gold medal with his partner  Yong-kyu Lim  and they would be exempt from South Korea’s mandatory 21-month military service — a reward reserved for Korean athletes who win titles in major international competitions. Chung and Lim were nearly eliminated in the semifinals against the Indian team of Yuki Bhambri and Divij Sharan  prevailing in a supertiebreaker  11-9. They then went on to win the final. “We saved like four match points in the semifinals ” Chung said this week in the players’ restaurant at Melbourne Park. “If I lose that match  maybe I am not here now. I would have to go to the army.” None “Look  I’m very excited to play Chung ” said Federer  36  who will face an opponent 15 years his junior at this late stage of a major tournament for the first time. “I thought he played an incredible match against Novak. To beat him here is one of the tough things to do in our sport  I believe. I know that Novak maybe wasn’t at 110 percent  but he was all right. He was giving it a fight till the very end. To close it out  that was mighty impressive.” None That was the first Grand Slam final that Chung remembered watching on television  but he had been pretending to be Djokovic for years in makeshift matches against his older brother  Hong  in a parking lot in front of the family’s home and elsewhere. “It was similar like minitennis ” Chung said. “My model was Novak  and my brother liked Rafa because he is playing also lefty.” So who won  Novak or Rafa? “I think Rafa won because Novak was too small ” Chung said with a laugh  gesturing toward Hong  24  who was sitting nearby. The Chungs’ father  Suk-jin  played tennis. But Hong was the real measuring stick  although their mother  Young-mi  confirmed on Tuesday that Hyeon began playing tennis after a doctor said it would help his poor eyesight. “The doctor said instead of looking at the tiny letters of the book  it’s better to look at the green color ” she said through a translator. “In Korea  all the fences around the tennis courts were green. His older brother was already playing tennis  so he started playing tennis as a hobby.” The younger brother eventually grew up  and Hyeon said he beat Hong twice in Asian Futures events. “My brother was always nice about it  and I really appreciate it ” Hyeon said. He is now an imposing athlete  one whose acrobatic defense and ability to generate power in extension look very familiar. “Reminds me obviously a lot of Novak ” Federer said. “The way he’s able to slide on forehand and backhand and use the hard court as a clay court and get balls back and stay aggressive in defense.” Though unseeded upon arrival in Melbourne  the 58th-ranked Chung was considered a leader of the new wave in men’s tennis  which has been called Next Gen by ATP Tour leaders who are deeply concerned about beginning to bridge the charisma chasm that will be left when Federer  Djokovic and Rafael Nadal move on. None But can you still be considered a Next Gen player when you are in the final four of a Grand Slam tournament? The answer seems obvious  and it must be even more self-evident to the players Chung has swashbuckled his way past in Melbourne. On Wednesday in the quarterfinals  Chung  in the favorite’s role  for a change  ended the run of 97th-ranked Tennys Sandgren of the United States. “He does so many cool things with how he moves and how he returns and how he plays with his forehand ” Sandgren said. “It was kind of like an extremely difficult puzzle to try to figure out. I wasn’t able to figure it out  but I enjoyed trying.” The victory made Chung the first Korean  male or female  to reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam singles tournament. It also guaranteed that Chung will become the highest-ranked South Korean player in history after the Australian Open  surpassing Hyung-taik Lee  who peaked at No. 36 in the ATP rankings in 2007. Chung will break into the top 30 on Monday and could go as high as No. 10  if he wins the tournament. None Chung’s agent  Stuart Duguid of WME/IMG  described the South Korean tennis market as “emerging.” “I’d say it replicates Japan at the early stages of Kei’s career ” he said. “It’s potentially very lucrative.” Gimmick or no gimmick  the Next Gen tournament in Milan appears to have played a role in helping Chung move on to bigger things in a hurry. “In my opinion  because of that tournament  he really started to believe  ‘I can win tournaments  and I can beat two  three or four good players in a row ’ ” said Neville Godwin  Chung’s new South African coach. “Every match at Next Gen was maybe not in the same environment as Melbourne  but it was a big stage  and you had to bring your best stuff. And I think the scoring system they used with shorter sets meant there were way more big points  so those guys are pretty well geared up for this year. Hyeon worked really hard in the off-season because he knew what he was capable of.” Godwin was aware  too. After four years working with the South African veteran Kevin Anderson  they split at the end of last season  when Godwin was voted ATP coach of the year. Anderson shares an agent with Chung  and Duguid reached out to Godwin about working with Chung  who is based in Seoul. Chung’s English is improving  which made working with an English-speaking coach more attractive. Godwin was intrigued by the idea of molding a great young talent (Anderson is 31). “There were a few things Hyeon just needed to do a little bit better ” Godwin said. “Obviously he has got great wheels  but you can’t just defend for 10 years as a pro  otherwise you end up like Andy Murray with hip surgery and probably sooner.” Godwin and Chung changed Chung’s serve in the off-season  bringing his feet closer together to create a more solid platform for him to deploy his extraordinary leg strength. “It’s kind of like an Andy Roddick serve ” Godwin said  referring to the retired American star. “Obviously Hyeon’s legs are the power base of his game. The more he can bring them into the equation  the better.” Chung will need to sprint  lunge and blunt attack after attack if he is to stay with Federer  who has yet to drop a set and is closing in on his 20th major singles title with none of his traditional rivals in the mix for a change. This will be Federer’s 43rd appearance in a Grand Slam semifinal  an Open era record by a big margin. This will be Chung’s first. But it is worth remembering  as he walks onto the blue court wearing his white-frame glasses  that Chung has played for high stakes before and ended up with a gold medal. “He clearly has nothing to lose ” Federer said. “I will tell myself the same  and we’ll see what happens.” None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/sports/tennis/season-lookahead-2018.html,Wishes for Tennis in 2018 Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None Tennis officials like to view their sport as a meritocracy. Great talent  it seems  can emerge from anywhere and then rise through head-to-head competition. But the truth is that inequalities and special privileges abound  and as a new season begins in earnest with the 2018 Australian Open  the timing seems right to launch this year’s wish list by lobbying for an end to one of the game’s most unnecessary perks. Reciprocal wild cards between Grand Slam nations might be a present-day symbol of the solidarity among the most prestigious tournaments  but they are also an outdated symbol of elitism in a sport where the barriers to entry are already high. And yet the practice continues with the Australian Open  French Open and United States Open exchanging singles wild cards (Wimbledon  to its credit  has not joined). A place in the main draw at a major is increasingly lucrative. First-round losers at this year’s Australian Open will earn $60 000 Australian dollars (about $47 000 United States dollars)  more than double the 2013 figure. Receiving one of the eight wild cards is a financial windfall  and they do increase the opportunities for French  American and Australian players at the expense of those from less privileged tennis nations. I would argue that eight wild cards — more than 6 percent of the draw — is too many unless they are genuinely going to be used to enhance a major’s global appeal or serve some higher purpose. That is rarely how they are deployed. If the Australians want to use their wild cards on Australians  that seems logical  even if the record shows that most home-nation wild cards are quickly eliminated. But extending that advantage to other Grand Slam nations is nothing more than mutual back scratching. Better use? Follow the Wimbledon example and be more open to bestowing wild cards on rising players  irrespective of their nationalities  who have proven in recent months that they have great potential. Or on stars  irrespective of their nationalities  who have dropped in the rankings. Another option: organize a wild-card playoff for the top-ranked players from underrepresented tennis nations or regions and grant the winner a spot in the main draw. The Australian Open already does a version of this  offering a men’s and women’s singles wild card to the winners of its Asia-Pacific playoff. That seems the right message considering that Australia is part of the Asia-Pacific region and drawing an increasing number of spectators from that zone. What seems considerably less fair is to hand over free passes to French and American players simply because they come from far-away nations who can return the favor.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/sports/tennis/australian-open-backward-cap.html,In Tennis  the Backward Cap Makes No Sense. Nevertheless  It Persists. Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None MELBOURNE  Australia — First  a confession: I still wear my cap backward when I play tennis  even at a certain age. So I come subjectively to this subject as I note that many years after the Swedish pro Mikael Pernfors inspired some of my generation of hackers to reverse our caps  and years after Australia’s Lleyton Hewitt made it definitively a thing in tennis  members of the new wave have acquired the taste  too. They include the American Jack Sock  Lucas Pouille of France  Karen Khachanov of Russia and the flashy Canadian teenager Denis Shapovalov. It has never been an entirely logical choice. The point of a hat in tennis is  first and foremost  to keep the sun out of your eyes — the sort of sun that has been beating down on the players all week at this torrid Australian Open. But the only way to keep the sun off your face is if the bill of the hat is facing the traditional direction. “Backwards makes absolutely zero sense ” said Brad Gilbert  an ESPN analyst and a longtime coach. And yet Hewitt’s sartorial legacy seems safe and sound  even if it once appeared that the backward cap might go the way of the wooden racket in tennis when he finally faded from the scene. None Guess which direction their caps were pointing when they won their first-round match on Thursday? Hewitt has been wearing his that way since the beginning. Darren Cahill  who is also from Adelaide  Australia  remembers getting a call from Hewitt’s parents about the possibility of coaching him and then getting a knock on his door. It was Hewitt  age 12  with his hat on backward. “The first conversation with him  I asked  ‘Why?’” Cahill said. “And he said  ‘I just like it backwards.’ And I said  ‘Aren’t you supposed to wear the peak of the hat to protect your nose and eyes and keep your eyes out of the sun? ’ and he said  ‘No  I just like it backwards.’ “And so I said  ‘All right.’ That was honestly the first time I’d ever seen it  and I think it was like a 10-second conversation  and I never asked him again. I think he wore that same hat for about three years straight.” None The younger set noticed. “I started wearing a hat backwards just because I thought it was cool  to be honest ” said Nick Kyrgios  the new and more unpredictable Australian No. 1. “Just wearing that hat backwards meant that sort of grinding mentality. Lleyton sort of made that his own sort of thing.” Beyond tennis  the backward cap has a long history. See hip-hop and baseball catchers and rally caps and Ken Griffey Jr. See Oscar Madison  “The Odd Couple” character played first by Walter Matthau on Broadway and then by Jack Klugman on television. Madison was a slovenly sportswriter (they may have been on to something). The look is now ubiquitous: Barack Obama wears his cap backward on vacation  Paul Ryan in the weight room. None But in tennis at least  the time for resistance has seemingly passed. On court  the backward cap is indeed a grinder thing  a dig-in-and-do-whatever-it-takes-to-win the-marathon-point thing. It might not keep the sun out of our eyes  but it can still keep some of the sweat out of our eyes. And once you get used to wearing one  it is also a security blanket in a sport where habits — good  bad or otherwise — can be hard to break. “I’ve been wearing my hat backwards for about five or six years now ” said Maximilian Marterer  a 22-year-old German who qualified for the Australian Open. “I did it at first because I had long hair  and I wanted to keep it in place. But I cut it  and I don’t really need it anymore. It’s confidence  so I’m keeping it.” Rafael Nadal  arranger of beverage bottles and adjuster of shorts  knows this all too well. It is working so far for Marterer in Melbourne. He was 0-14 in tour-level matches upon arrival  but has advanced to the third round. The French veterans Adrian Mannarino and Richard Gasquet also made it that far wearing their caps backward — a now-unusual move for Gasquet  who was once urged to ditch the style by a leading French tennis writer who saw it as a sign of his inability to grow up (or intimidate his opponents). “Who is afraid of a backwards cap and the childlike silhouette it creates?” Philippe Bouin wrote in L’Equipe 2007. “Come on!” Hewitt might have barked in response. Some have definitively moved on  though. It is largely forgotten that Federer  the balletic antithesis of the grinder  wore his hat backward for much of the match when he made his Grand Slam debut at the French Open in 1999 at age 17  losing in the first round to the Australian star Patrick Rafter. He soon switched to bandannas and started reserving the reversed cap for practice sessions  just like his longtime rival Rafael Nadal  even if Nadal seems much more of a natural for the get-down-to-business look. None Andy Murray tried backward caps in his junior days but ultimately did not see the point. The well-coiffed Milos Raonic  whose hair now has several Twitter accounts of its own  gave it a try  too. “I never really won with that look ” Raonic once explained. Others certainly have. In 1989  Ivan Lendl and Miloslav Mecir played the Australian Open final wearing backward caps  although Lendl switched in later years to the forward-facing legionnaire hat. Pernfors  a former University of Georgia star from Sweden  played with a crewcut and no hat when he reached the French Open final in 1986. But by 1990  when he reached the quarterfinals of the Australian Open  he was sporting a neon yellow cap backward with the brim turned up so it would not restrict him as he leaned back to hit a serve. “I wore it backwards when I was a kid when I actually had hair on my head ” said Paul Annacone  who played in Pernfors’s era. “It wasn’t like I thought  ‘This is cool.’ It was that I didn’t like headbands and didn’t want the bill in front unless the sun was in my eyes. But Pernfors did it on tour.” Others would follow his lead: Marc-Kevin Goellner and Tommy Haas of Germany  Fernando Meligeni of Brazil  Marcelo Rios of Chile in his early years  Guillermo Coria of Argentina  Sebastien Grosjean and Paul-Henri Mathieu of France. Very few women have joined in: Eleni Daniilidou of Greece and Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan on occasion  Martina Navratilova in the very late phases of her long career. But then few women wear hats at all on court. Even in the Australian heat  most opted for visors this week. Daria Kasatkina  the rising Russian  says it is a ponytail problem: Put the hat backward and the ponytail rides too low. Lucie Safarova  the Czech tennis star  thinks “women probably want to look more feminine with the visor  and the backwards look is more masculine.” Tastes and perceptions change  however  and as Hewitt exits and the Socks and Shapovalovs and the rest of us carry on backward  who knows who will be inspired next?

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/sports/tennis/tennis-anti-corruption-report.html,Review Finds ‘Tsunami’ of Fixed Matches in Lower Levels of Tennis Advertisement Supported by None Professional tennis has created an environment ripe for corruption at the sport’s lowest levels and needs reform to combat the problem  an independent task force reported on Wednesday after a two-year investigation. The review panel of three prominent lawyers found that there was a “tsunami” of fixed matches at the lower levels of the game  but also that there was no conspiracy or collusion among the sport’s governing bodies to cover it up. None None “The first finding is that the nature and extent of the integrity problem facing tennis is serious and substantial  in particular in the lower levels of the sport ” Adam Lewis  the head of the panel  said at a news conference in London on Wednesday afternoon. He referred to the lower levels of the sport as a “lamentably fertile breeding ground for breaches of integrity.” None The expansion of live data rights to those lowest  most vulnerable levels of competition has incubated corruption  the report said  adding that the risks of the deal were not adequately considered. “Whilst these deals have generated considerable funds for the sport  they have also greatly expanded the available markets for betting on the lowest levels of professional tennis ” the panel said. “The I.T.F. did not appropriately assess the potential adverse effects of these agreements before entering into them.” The report cited a veteran investigator for the Tennis Integrity Unit who estimated that “hundreds of matches at Futures level (both singles and doubles) are not being played fairly  with the numbers reducing as you move upwards through the ranks of the professional game.” The available evidence  including a significant increase in the number of alerts sent when a match had unusual betting patterns or other suspicious circumstances  showed that the problem had worsened after the sale of the data rights. In 2012  there were only three match alerts at the Futures level  by 2016  that number had increased to 240. (From 2009 to 2017  men’s matches were responsible for 83 percent of T.I.U.’s alerts.) The dissolution of the data deal was the first of the 12 recommendations in the report. “Discontinuing the sale of official data at these lowest levels of tennis is a necessary  pragmatic and effective approach to containing betting-related breaches of integrity ” the report said. But the panel did not recommend restricting data at the next tier of men’s events  the ATP Challenger Tour  where the rate of suspicious match reports is more than twice what it is at the Futures level. Data rights on that tour are owned by IMG  the sports and entertainment management company. Live data from these tournaments can be used by gambling sites  particularly for wagers that can be made on elements of a match as it progresses. Alex Inglot  a spokesman for Sportradar  called the proposal to end the company’s agreement with the I.T.F. for data rights at Futures events “unrealistic ” “potentially unlawful” and “heavy-handed.” “Prohibition simply doesn’t work ” Inglot said in a statement. “Prohibiting data partnerships will not stop betting  live or otherwise  on these matches nor will it remove corruption risk at this level. Pre-match betting will remain available  unofficial data will be collected  generally available match statistics can be used by betting operators anyway  the risk of data fraud and ghost matches will increase  and there will be no clear contractual basis by which operators will be bound to reporting and transparency requirements. This will almost certainly encourage black market activity.” None But the review panel disagreed  citing the increased volume of betting on the lower levels of the sport  which has proved to be the most vulnerable to match fixing. It also suggested that the sport at large should help compensate the I.T.F. for the lost revenue if it follows the panel’s recommendation and ends the Sportradar deal. The panel insisted that the lucrative nature of the data sales should not be used as justification to continue the practice  saying that “the resolution of significant integrity concerns cannot be driven by the question of financial return — even when much of it is redistributed to the sport.” The panel also recommended eliminating sponsorships from betting companies. The report said the Tennis Integrity Unit  which was established in 2008 to investigate betting-related corruption  should be reorganized to give it independent oversight apart from the sport’s governing bodies: the ATP  the WTA  the I.T.F. and the four Grand Slam tournaments. None None “The panel has not in that investigation discovered any evidence establishing a cover-up of breaches of integrity by the international governing bodies  by the T.I.U. or by anyone else in relation to these matters ” Lewis said. “However  the panel has discovered what it considers to be errors made and opportunities missed by tennis in relation to these matters.” None The panel called for the Tennis Integrity Unit to have greater transparency in its proceedings and better cooperation with law enforcement. It also criticized the T.I.U. for lacking personnel with expertise in betting or tennis  many employees of the integrity unit are former police officers. The panel also recommended wider training for players  better security around players at tournaments  and methods to prevent online abuse. There were also recommendations to reform the pathway players take through the lower tiers of tennis to shore up “incentive problems” that exist when players earning little prize money are vulnerable to selling matches. Many of the proposed changes have been carried out in some form over the past two years. Tennis has already pulled back from several major betting sponsorships  with the Australian Open ending a deal with William Hill and the I.T.F. ending a partnership with Betway. The integrity unit has increased its staff and its budget  and has begun regularly releasing information about its activities in an effort to be more transparent. None Some of the proposed changes could affect top players as well. The panel suggested that appearance fees should be made public and that tanking in a match could be considered an integrity offense even without an intentional connection to a betting outcome.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/sports/tennis/davis-cup-itf-pique.html,I.T.F. Proposes a Huge Makeover for a Stale Davis Cup Advertisement Supported by On Tennis None It is a pity it had to come to this  but with Davis Cup withering and rival events surfacing  the feeling was that something had to give. On Monday  tradition did. In what would arguably be the biggest change to the Davis Cup since its creation in 1900  the International Tennis Federation announced plans to transform the annual national-team competition through what it called a 25-year  $3 billion partnership with an international investment group headed by the Spanish soccer star Gerard Piqué. The lucrative proposal  which requires final approval in August by the I.T.F.’s general membership  would change the top level of Davis Cup into a weeklong event in November involving 18 nations  with best-of-three-set matches played at a single site. The plan is to implement the overhaul for 2019  but approval  in light of the general membership’s conservative voting record  is far from guaranteed. “It’s politically tricky and no sure thing that this gets rubber-stamped ” Jim Courier  the American Davis Cup captain  said in an interview on Monday while expressing support for the plan. Currently  16 men’s teams play in Davis Cup’s top division  known as the World Group  in a home-and-away format over four rounds interspersed throughout the season  and all live matches are best of five sets. Some former Davis Cup champions  like Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia  consider the proposal a travesty. “Terrible ” Kafelnikov said in an interview Monday. “The value and spirit of the whole team competition is gone.” But like many influential figures in the game  I.T.F. President David Haggerty is convinced that big moves are necessary to keep the event relevant. Haggerty said the proposal had received unanimous support from the I.T.F.’s board of directors. Though mild-mannered in person  Haggerty is unafraid to make bold moves (if this one fails  his bid for re-election in 2019 certainly will suffer  too). A former tennis industry executive and a former president of the United States Tennis Association  Haggerty was among those who pushed successfully for a roof over Arthur Ashe Stadium at the U.S. Open and for the U.S.T.A.’s vast new complex at Lake Nona in Orlando  Fla. “Certainly this is a big decision for the I.T.F. ” Haggerty said by telephone from London on Monday. “We know the environment has changed in tennis over the last few years. Players are playing later in their careers. It’s a very physical sport  so I think many factors were taken into account. “At the same time  if you go back 50 years ago  in Bournemouth they had the first Open tennis event. There had to have been a number of tennis leaders sitting around saying  ‘Jeez  tennis is O.K.  do we really need to make this change? What is it going to do to us? Is it good or bad?’ You never know  so that strength of conviction  they had that at the time. They took a risk  but look how tennis has changed. Perhaps in the future  we will look back on this and say the I.T.F. board took such a risk.” Haggerty also wants a more solid financial base for the I.T.F.  which has become the weakest pillar among the sport’s bloated network of governing bodies. The money could indeed be transformative: Haggerty said the partnership with Kosmos  the investment firm headed by Piqué and backed by the 52-year-old Japanese billionaire Hiroshi Mikitani  would provide more than $20 million in prize money for the players in the final phase each year. If the $3 billion figure is correct  it would also provide the I.T.F.  whose main source of revenue is Davis Cup  with an unheard-of influx of cash to fund its own activities  which include developing the game worldwide and running amateur and lower-level professional circuits. Haggerty also said that national federations would benefit. If the overhaul is approved  only the seasons ahead will determine who was correct in their assessment: the Kafelnikovs or the Haggertys. But one can understand the lure and the timing. Despite pockets of passion  and a compelling history  Davis Cup is losing traction globally. There were certainly less extreme potential solutions: A partnership with the ATP Tour  shifting the Davis Cup dates away from such proximity to Grand Slam tournaments  or switching to a biennial format that might have lured the biggest stars. But after being thwarted last year in an attempt to tweak the format with smaller changes  like using a neutral-site final and best-of-three-set singles matches  Haggerty doubled down and pushed instead for more radical change. At least initially  the event would most likely be held in Asia  Haggerty said  and because of the number of courts required  it would most likely be staged outdoors. “The next step in my view to make this event all it could be would be to include the Fed Cup in this tennis extravaganza ” Courier said  referring to the I.T.F’s women’s team competition. “That should be the ultimate goal.” For now  the I.T.F. is focused on expanding Fed Cup’s top division from eight to 16 teams  although Haggerty expressed support for a similar  single-site Fed Cup competition in the future. In the Davis Cup proposal  the plan is for the 18 national teams to be divided into six groups of three for round-robin play over three days. Each team would have four players  and each encounter would include two singles matches and one doubles match. Eight teams would advance to the quarterfinals (the six group winners plus the two best second-place teams) and would be guaranteed a spot in the following year’s final phase. During the week  the strongest eight of the 10 eliminated teams would then play for a place in the following year’s competition against the eight teams who have come through home-and-away qualifying during the Davis Cup’s traditional dates earlier in the season. The semifinals would be played on Saturday  and the final on Sunday. “The nice thing is that by the end of the week  you’ll know the 16 teams playing in next year’s event ” Haggerty said. He said the 17th and 18th teams would be selected by the I.T.F. and Kosmos “based on criteria to be determined.” Such an overhaul would have been unthinkable in Davis Cup’s heyday  when its prestige was on par with the four Grand Slam tournaments in the 1930s  ’40s and ’50s. But those moments are long gone  even if Davis Cup continues to generate big crowds and enthusiasm in several countries  including France  which won the title for the 10th time last year. But many leading players and tennis officials have been clamoring for a change in format for decades. In this golden age in the men’s game  the biggest stars — including Roger Federer  Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic — have all been part of winning Davis Cup teams but have rarely participated at the same time as one another and have faced each other too rarely in the event. None But the biggest threat was the ATP’s recent interest in relaunching the single-week World Team Cup  which could have further reduced top players’ interest in committing to Davis Cup. Piqué’s group  with support from Djokovic  first negotiated with the ATP and its executive chairman Chris Kermode about creating such an event before turning to the I.T.F. in late November. The result was Monday’s announcement. The Davis Cup — and tennis — may never be the same. None None None Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/23/sports/hockey/andrea-barone-gay-referee.html,A Gay Referee Tries to Find His Place in Hockey Andrea Barone nearly quit his job as a minor league hockey referee after years of hearing coaches and players use anti-gay language during games. None This is a story about love and betrayal. Andrea Barone was barely 18 months old when he first set out on the ice  his tiny legs shaking and pushing behind a chair along the cold surface. If  in Montreal  hockey is religion  then this was baptism by ritual  every morning practice  every unsteady drag of his skates  drawing him closer to the game he was falling for. “We never had to wake him up in the morning ” Barone’s mother  Beba  said. “If the practice was at 7  he’d be up dressed and ready to go. He just fell in love.” Barone is 28 now  many years removed from those innocent skates under the eye of his father  Remo. Late last summer  during an interview at a Toronto coffeehouse  he was upset. Barone is sure of two things about himself: He is a hockey man  and he is a gay man. In the sport he has devoted his life to  this has proved an untenable intersection. Advertisement None Advertisement And yet  for some time now  Barone has been trying to decide if hockey is still for him. In high school  as his excellence as a player faded  Barone became a referee. It was his way to stay in the sport  and he has been promoted through the professional ranks  reaching the ECHL  two levels below the N.H.L. Barone believes a call-up to the American Hockey League is coming soon  and from there  if all he has worked for goes as planned  he could reach the N.H.L. in a few years. No man  working in any capacity  is known to be openly gay at hockey’s highest level. More than that  at a time when players from the N.B.A.  the N.F.L. and Major League Baseball have come out after retirement  the same cannot be said for any man formerly associated with the N.H.L. Barone has been trying  often in vain  to correct a culture that for decades has made little attempt to conceal its regular use of anti-gay language. The insults came from coaches  who would roll their eyes when warned against the use of homophobic slurs on the ice. Or they came from players  who used the barbs as a way to emasculate or demean the opponents across from them. For years  Barone handled the pointed words  the casual insensitivity that said to him that he and people like him were not welcome. It was  in some way  the price of living in this world as a gay man. He tolerated it until last spring  when an ECHL coach  whose team had blown a third-period lead in a playoff game  charged at him. In front of three other referees  Barone said  the coach used a graphic  expletive-laced anti-gay slur. Barone  known to the league and its personnel to be gay  was furious. Then he was hurt. The episode was witnessed by several people and was reported immediately to the league  but the coach was only fined  Barone said  and then was allowed behind the bench for his next game. (The ECHL declined to answer questions about the episode  and Barone asked that the coach’s name not be used.) Advertisement The way the league handled the case told Barone he had an unsolvable problem: He loved hockey  but hockey would never love him back. Weeks after the attack  the referee sat down to write. “For the last ten years  I have been in an abusive relationship ” he typed. “But I’ve finally ended it. Scarred  heartbroken  bruised. “I am walking away.” Barone can close his eyes and still see the enraged coach and how his lips shaped when he fired those awful words. It was last April  in an arena outside Salt Lake City. He isn’t sure if the coach said what he did because Barone dates men  but the coach’s intent did not quite seem to matter. He had used the language and used it publicly. It wounded Barone that the coach was only fined for his behavior. Barone had learned to bury his feelings. Months earlier  while he was refereeing a game in Alaska  an ECHL player directed an anti-gay slur at another player on the ice. This was no uncommon gesture  though when Barone asked the player’s coach to take care of the situation  the coach dismissed him. “Oh  come on  Dre ” the coach said  according to Barone. “Don’t make this about you.” Barone  upset  could only skate away. But in Utah  in the minutes before the next game of the series  Barone still could not shake things. He allowed himself to revel for a moment in the allure of vengeance. When the puck dropped  Barone thought about ejecting the coach immediately. “If the league’s not going to suspend you ” he said to himself  “I will.” (Through his team  the coach did not respond to requests for comment.) In the end  Barone knew it was the wrong thing for a referee to do. Such a reaction would have distracted from the message  and it could have made the story about Barone. It was never supposed to be about him. Once his ECHL season concluded  Barone retreated into a darkness. Defeat took hold of him. Over breakfast in Toronto one morning  Beba observed that her son  usually so outgoing and vibrant  had changed. “He was so quiet ” she said. “He was so pensive.” Advertisement Not long after  Barone opened his laptop on the couch. “I never understood why people stay in abusive relationships for so long  but now I do ” he wrote. “Simply because it took me ten years to realise that it was indeed an abusive relationship. “First I hoped for change  it never came. Then I worked for change  it never happened. Finally I forced for change  but I was the one who had to change.” There are few men in hockey who seem to embody the sport quite like Brian Burke  whose famous gruffness toward a prying scrum of reporters as an executive roughly equaled his playing style as a college and minor league scrapper in the 1970s. He has spent nearly all his life in hockey  but Burke  62  the president of the Calgary Flames  has come to represent something else to the game. In 2009  when Burke was president and general manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs  his son Brendan revealed himself to be gay. Though Brendan  then 20  held no position with the league  he immediately became something rare: an openly gay man with proximity to the N.H.L. Burke threw an arm around his son  and the father became a champion of gay rights in sports  marching forward by Brendan’s side until the moment unimaginable grief found him. On Feb. 5  2010  just three months after he came out  Brendan was killed in a car accident along a snowy Indiana highway. None Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. Before his death  Brendan confided something to his father. As a teenager  Brendan played varsity hockey for his high school in Massachusetts  but later quit to join a town team instead. “He told me long after high school that it was because homophobic language made him uncomfortable ” Burke said. It has fallen on Burke  more than anyone else in hockey  to clean up a culture in the sport that made Brendan feel so unwelcome. Through Hockey Is For Everyone and You Can Play  an N.H.L.-backed initiative founded in 2012 by Burke’s elder son  Patrick  the league has made strides. Burke said Flames players had approached him unsolicited  reporting that if there were ever any gay players on the team  they would be greeted warmly. Of the first openly gay man to play in the N.H.L.  whoever he should be and whenever he should arrive  Burke said  “I think he’s going to find that the road isn’t as rocky as he thinks it’s going to be.” Advertisement None None The Shaw suspension was a landmark measure by the N.H.L. But a year later  when Anaheim’s Ryan Getzlaf was caught during the postseason angrily calling an official the same slur used against Barone  Getzlaf was only fined and allowed to play his next game. The league declined repeated requests to receive questions for this article  or to comment further on the Getzlaf episode. But to many in the gay community  the decision undid much of the evolution the league had made with Shaw’s punishment. In the history of pro hockey  there are known to be very few gay male players. One is Peter Karlsson  a Swedish defenseman. In 1995  he died after being stabbed 60 times  the killer reportedly sickened by Karlsson’s sexuality. Another is Brock McGillis  a Canadian junior goalie who later competed professionally in Europe. When McGillis was a player  he kept himself closeted and dated women. He felt so unwanted as a gay man in hockey that he began to drink away the pain. “I hated myself ” he said. “Most days  I woke up wanting to die  and I went to bed wanting to die.” Advertisement None “Legal or not ” Reynolds continued  gay marriage “will always be wrong.” Avery is not gay  though while he was in the N.H.L.  he said  players and fans would yell anti-gay slurs at him. “But I’m also straight  so that certainly doesn’t hurt ” he said. “But if I had a gay teammate  which I’m pretty sure I did at some point — God  I can’t imagine what he was feeling like. “He was probably thinking  ‘Thank God they think it’s him.’” Barone has lived no easy life. On Sept. 13  2006  he stared down a gunman at Dawson College in Montreal  lucky to escape a notorious school shooting in Canada’s history. What followed were years of crippling depression  a result of the carnage he saw but also of his own demons  his fight to acknowledge and accept his sexuality. “You feel like a zombie ” he said of his darkest times. “You’re in the black. You can’t see or be seen.” What he had was hockey. And yet he was finding that even his lone sanctuary was shutting him out. It’s why he speaks up. Later this year  Barone plans to join GLAAD  the advocacy group for L.G.B.T.Q. people  to talk of how critical inclusion is in sports. He has even founded his own outreach campaign  #NeverAlone. He may never be treated equally in hockey  but at least he can fight to ensure that anti-gay language is considered unacceptable. Over late spring and summer  Barone took many months to decide his future. The letter he wrote after the Utah episode was titled “Goodbye Hockey ” so sure was he then that the sport had won  that he would wilt away to find another life. Advertisement But he began to grasp that there is so much more to do if he sticks to this dream  so much more to achieve if he can earn his place as the first openly gay man in the N.H.L. A friend put it to Barone this way: “You can’t stop now. It’s like if you had a lottery ticket  and you had five of the six numbers right before they draw the last number. And you want to throw out the ticket.” Barone returned to the ECHL  a place where he has carved a reputation as a fine and fair official. Colin Chaulk  coach of the Brampton Beast  told of a time Barone made a tough call to end a tense shootout and could be found in the coach’s office immediately after  scouring the tape to see if he had made the correct ruling. “It just shows that he cares ” Chaulk said. “Only two or three guys have ever done that in my years of coaching.” During one game he worked this season  Barone came upon the coach who had attacked him. He had been curious if the coach might apologize  or if there might be any acknowledgment of what had happened the previous spring. Barone had such low expectations that he almost had to laugh in resignation when nothing was said. “This ” he lamented  “is the world I live in.” What Barone can control is his time on the ice  where he has continued to hone his craft  study and improve. The A.H.L. feels so close  and from there  who knows? Hockey’s biggest stage may one day call. But this is a story about love and betrayal. Andrea Barone will carry on in what he believes to be an abusive relationship  not knowing quite how to leave. In his heart he holds a sad truth: Hockey is most likely not done hurting him.

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/sports/soccer/lyngby-bk-bankruptcy.html,A Week Inside a Soccer Club When the Money Runs Out Advertisement None None KONGENS LYNGBY  Denmark — Mads Byder sent the text message to everyone he could think of  anyone who had the money — and maybe the madness — to help. In the end  he copied and pasted the message 15 times  changing the name of the recipient  but nothing else. All the texts started the same way: “Hey  long time no see.” And they all cut quickly to the chase. “You have seen what is happening ” he wrote. “This is not an investment — it is fun. And sometimes  you have to invest with the heart.” Byder did not have time to be creative. He had  by that stage  roughly a day  maybe a little more  to prevent the century-old Danish soccer club he had supported all his life  Lyngby B.K.  from slipping into oblivion. Its current owner had run out of money. Its staff members had been told their jobs were gone. The team’s insurance had run out. The players had not been paid. Several had already left. Many more would follow if new owners could not be found. Byder was sending messages because he was the last resort. Advertisement He had been told as much the previous night when Birger Jorgensen  Lyngby’s longtime sporting director  had called him at home close to midnight. Advertisement Over the next 36 hours  the two led a last-gasp attempt to help Lyngby avert the thing that fans across the world fear more than anything: not that their club will lose a final  or miss out on a tournament  or even suffer the indignity of relegation  but that it will cease to exist entirely. Every year  through careless management or reckless ambition  a handful of teams come uncomfortably close to collapse. Those who do fall — Rangers or Leeds United or Parma — serve as cautionary tales about the dangers of living beyond your means. But they are not heeded. Still  every year  more clubs flirt with disaster. In the first week of February  Lyngby came closer than most to the edge. Mathias Tauber  the club captain  said that  at one point  the club was “15 minutes” from going under. The story of those few days offers an insight not just into what it takes to rescue a club  but also into how players cope when they stand on the brink. The hotel  Mathias Hebo said  was perfect. At the end of January  Hebo and the rest of Lyngby’s players had flown to Faro  a resort town on the Algarve coast in Portugal  for a warm-weather training camp. “Very good pitches  20 degrees Celsius  all the stuff ” he said. Hebo had joined the club the previous summer. He was 21  playing for Fredericia in Denmark’s second tier  and Lyngby seemed the ideal step up: a club close to his family in Copenhagen  with a proud reputation for developing players — Lyngby has produced a scree of Danish internationals  including four members of Denmark’s 1992 European championship team — and the promise  after a third-place finish in the league in 2017  of Europa League games this season. There had been interest in Hebo from Brondby  historically Denmark’s biggest club  and from teams in Sweden  too  but “Lyngby’s plan for me was the most impressive ” he said. “As soon as I got the call  I knew this is what I would do.” None The luxurious trip to Faro seemed like another of the benefits Hebo would have to get used to  earlier in the season  Lyngby had flown by private jet to a Europa League match against Krasnodar in Russia. This was the life of a Superliga player. And then  five days into the winter training camp in Faro  Hebo and his teammates found out that life was about to end. “One day  Ekstra Bladet  a Danish newspaper  did a big story that Lyngby might close ” Hebo said. The team’s owner  Torben Jensen  could no longer fund the club  the newspaper reported  as his finance firm  Hellerup Finans  was on the verge of bankruptcy. Advertisement “The staff had warned us ” Hebo said. “And then my phone just started ringing all the time.” The players approached their coach  Thomas Norgaard  seeking more information  and he passed on what Jensen had told him. “We were told everything was under control ” Tauber said. “He said we were not floating in money  but everything would be fine.” By the time the squad returned to Denmark  though  it was clear that was overly optimistic. Though Jensen had assured the coaching staff he was doing his best to find a solution  to cover his obligations  it had all been to no avail. As sporting director  Jorgensen had been trying his best to drum up an angel investor  but had drawn a blank  too. The edge was approaching. On Jan. 31  the players were told that their monthly salaries — due that day — would not been paid. “We were nervous then ” said Thomas Sorensen  one of the team’s veterans. “That is when you realize it is really serious.” For them  and for the club. The players learned from their union that  under Danish law  they could file a claim against Lyngby for their unpaid wages. If the club did not produce the money within three working days  they could consider their contracts broken  and negotiate to join other teams. On Friday  the players submitted the claim. By the following Tuesday  Feb. 6  the money had not arrived. Lyngby’s entire squad  about to return from winter break in the middle of a season that had begun in the Europa League  was free to leave. For a week  Jorgensen had been trying to stave off disaster. He had contacted everyone he could think of who might be able to step unto the breach. He had even been in touch with a handful of English clubs  including Aston Villa  in the hope that one might view Lyngby as a suitable farm team. None of it had borne fruit. Five players had already decided not to wait around to be rescued. Jorgensen was worried about a mass exodus. When he called Byder  on Wednesday  Feb. 7  Jorgensen said he “was throwing in the towel ” Byder remembered. Advertisement The two knew each other only cursorily: Byder’s public relations company had once sponsored Lyngby  putting its name on the team’s blue jerseys  and he was still a regular at games. When he called  Jorgensen told Byder that a mutual friend had passed him his phone number. Not a problem  Byder said  but why? “I heard you have a big blue heart ” Jorgensen responded. He did  but his wallet was not big enough to save the club alone. All Byder could offer was an idea. Lyngby sits 20 minutes north of Copenhagen  in one of the richest areas of Denmark  known as the country’s equivalent to Silicon Valley. He suggested to Jorgensen that perhaps “many minor investors  local investors  could find a few million kroner each” and come together to keep Lyngby B.K. from folding. Jorgensen  despite several days without sleep  agreed it was worth a shot. The next day  Byder sent out his flurry of texts. Not all of those he contacted shared his enthusiasm. “People sent messages or called saying it was not for them  but they understood why I was doing it ” he said. “And a few said: ‘Don’t do it yourself.’” Byder  though  had a feeling that he wanted to give something back to the club that had given him good  and bad  memories. “I was ready to pay for that ” he said. “And I was ready to lose money for it  too.” Four or five of his entreaties worked  however. On Thursday night  together with a couple more names mustered by Jorgensen  10 people met at a private house near Lyngby. “There was no time for presentations ” Byder said. He  Jorgensen and Tommy Petersen  a financier  gave short speeches. They were not uniformly positive. None Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter. You must select a newsletter to subscribe to. View all New York Times newsletters. “Tommy said that we did not have time to look through the budget ” Byder said. “He did not know how big the black hole would be.” As captain  Tauber was busy that night  too. He had spent much of the previous year injured  nursing a torn knee ligament that — at 33 — threatened to end his career. He already had been considering what he would do if he was forced to retire. He could restart his law degree  on hiatus since he turned professional. He had even had an interview arranged with a digital marketing company. He did not feel ready to quit  he said  but he knew the club’s liquidation would make the choice for him. “I find it very hard to imagine that any club would want an injured 33-year-old ” he said. Advertisement As Lyngby’s situation deteriorated during those frantic days  though  Tauber had found himself front and center  being a captain once more. The players had decided only he would speak to the news media. “We wanted to protect some of the younger players ” he said. “To make sure that what was coming out from us made sense in some way.” Every morning before training  the players would hold a short meeting. Tauber would relay what he  Sorensen and another senior player  Jeppe Brandrup  had learned  and then field a few questions. The union’s advice was consistent: Keep quiet  say nothing  file the claim  see what happens. That changed when the money did not arrive on Tuesday. Suddenly  Lyngby’s players were free to go. “From my perspective  I could not force players to stay ” Tauber said. “The club had a problem  but the players needed to be able to choose whether to wait  or to go elsewhere and not be worried.” Together with Sorensen and Brandrup  he told the team that there would be no hard feelings for anyone who decided to go immediately. The rest  he said  would wait until Friday at 3 p.m. If no money arrived then  if no new owner had been found  they would have no choice but to leave. The mood was anxious. In private  the players would ask each other their intentions  but it was hard  Hebo said  to be sure everyone was being honest. “Maybe one person told you one thing and said something different to others ” he said. Surreptitious phone calls prompted suspicion: Was he talking to his agent  arranging a move? Tauber did what he could to canvass opinion. “I talked to almost everybody ” he said  about contracts  but also about wives  and children  and mortgages. Looking back  now  he knows that not everyone told him the truth. In the end  five players decided they could not take the risk  and left. One  Casper Nielsen  a fullback who had already agreed to sign for Aarhus at the end of the season  simply brought his move forward. Even then  Tauber said  “he refused to be the first: He would not be the one who took everyone with him.” By Thursday night  though  Tauber feared it was over. He had heard there might be a chance of salvation  but time was running out. The artificial deadline — 3 p.m. the next day — was fast approaching. “I knew it was close  but I also knew they were missing a few million kroner ” he said of the new investors. And so he spent that night on the phone to his teammates one more time  to “hear their situations  hear their thoughts.” Advertisement At 6 a.m. on Friday  Byder’s phone beeped. “Thanks for last night ” read the first email on the thread. Seven of the potential investors that had gathered the previous night had agreed to try to save the club. A local lawyer  Lars Borring  registered a company: The Friends of Lyngby had been born. That morning  the members started transferring money — some $50 000  some closer to $1 million — to replenish the club’s accounts. After training  the squad gathered in the canteen at Lyngby’s stadium. The last of the money had landed in the new company’s accounts with 15 minutes to spare. Petersen and Jorgensen told the players the money was in place. They would be paid. “Boom  like that  everyone stays ” Hebo said. In his car on the way home  Tauber cried with relief. Byder  though  had another problem. The bank account was empty again. There were  at the start  seven Friends of Lyngby. There are now more than 20: lawyers and chief executives and restaurateurs  as well as several players who started their careers at the club’s academy. Andreas Bjelland  a Danish international now with Brentford in England  was the first  three others have followed. They are  as Byder said  a “team behind the team ” their experience in a whole swath of industries  all of which he believes can help develop the club in some way. “We reflect different resources ” he said. Sponsors are returning  too  eager to be involved. The club’s accounts  quickly emptied to pay the players’ overdue wages and the team’s outstanding bills  have been filled again. The new owners remain open to further investment  the only requirement is that any further Friends should not have “terms and conditions” to their input. This is with the heart  as Byder told the first few to sign up  it is investing in fun. They are aware  though  that there is a limit to how far they can take the club. Byder has held more meetings with Aston Villa about a potential partnership  but other clubs are hovering  too: one or two from England  and Club Brugge from Belgium. Networks of clubs  economies of scale  are all the rage in global soccer these days. Manchester City  which already owns teams in New York  Melbourne and Montevideo  has been alerted to Lyngby’s willingness to talk. Byder does not rule anything out: He noted  with a smile  that David Beckham’s Miami franchise might be an interesting prospect. Advertisement More immediately  though  there is another battle looming. Lyngby finds itself in a protracted relegation battle  thanks to Denmark’s complex system of playoffs. It has struggled on the field since that nightmarish week in February  not simply because of the players who left — though that hardly helped — but because of the psychological damage it did. When players talk about Lyngby  they almost always mention family. “We care about each other  we understand each other ” Tauber said. That had always been the club’s strength: its familiarity  its warmth. “You can’t ask a Danish guy to explain the word hygge ” Sorensen said. “It is hard to put it into words  but it is where you feel you belong.” During that perilous week  though  that bond was sorely tested. Players were forced to think not about the collective  but about themselves: their futures  their fears  their needs. Training sessions lacked intensity because players feared injury more than usual: A bad tackle at the wrong time might have meant months without pay  without a new club. “I was worried that spirit might break ” Tauber said. “It did not  but we are challenged right now.” It has taken time to restore that spirit. It may take more yet. Relegation would be the unhappiest of codas to what should be a heartwarming story  but perhaps even that has had its sting drawn by what Lyngby went through. Clubs go up and down  but they always remain  as long as there are people ready to rescue them  people with big blue hearts. None None None See More » Go to Home Page » ,sports
https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/05/11/sports/cricket/11reuters-cricket-test-irl-pak-fans.html,"Rain Fails to Dampen Irish Enthusiasm for Test Cricket Advertisement Supported by None DUBLIN — It was hardly surprising to hear the words ""rain stopped play"" echo around Malahide Cricket Club when test cricket came to Ireland for the first time on Friday. Yet the grey skies around Dublin did not dampen the enthusiasm of the fans in green  many of whom had waited decades for the day Ireland might at last be granted the opportunity to play in the five-day format so steeped in tradition. ""I played cricket way back in the '50s and as a child  of course  you dreamed of playing the international stuff "" said Barry Ramsey  76  who travelled from the north-west county of Donegal with his son  Barclay  to see the landmark match against Pakistan.  ""Now to be at this stage  even though it's a long time since I played  is absolutely phenomenal."" Despite a World Cup win against Pakistan in 2007  an even more celebrated one over England in 2011 and their elevation to full test match status last year  Ireland has always seen cricket very much as a minority game  way behind soccer  rugby and the traditional sports of Gaelic football and hurling. Ramsey recalled playing in the cricket street leagues in Donegal  a Gaelic football stronghold  and having to bow his head in team photos for fear the Gaelic Athletic Association  which until 1971 banned members from playing or attending so-called ""foreign games""  would forbid him from playing football. Others were attending their first cricket game  keen to savour the occasion  while teachers brought lines of school children into the temporary stands  which were close to a 6 300 sell-out on the opening day. Australians John Stewart and Jeremy Jastrzav had flown from Sydney just for the test before returning home next Tuesday. The pair are members of the Randwick Petersham Cricket Club  an amateur team Ireland played against in a World Cup warm-up three years ago. ""Coming here and watching a test in Ireland is a bit of a unique experience  this is a bit different to the SCG (the world-famous Sydney Cricket Ground) for us. It's an historic game "" Stewart said. As the rain fell  those that stuck around sank some late morning pints while others decamped to the local pubs and coffee shops of the coastal suburban town. ""I'm here with a friend who's flown over from Manchester so we'll have good company and a bit of craic (fun) anyway "" said Jen Delaney  45  who left the south-western county of Wexford for London 25 years ago and flew in for the weekend.  ""I got into cricket in England  the Ashes is a good gateway drug!"" she said. No longer just constrained to the one-day game however  Ireland's enthusiastic fans will at least get four more shots at enjoying test cricket for the first time.  ""Could I swing Monday or Tuesday? Maybe "" said Barclay Ramsey. ""We'd be making nice phone calls into work!""  (Reporting by Padraic Halpin  Editing by Ian Chadband) Advertisement None None None Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS ",sports
