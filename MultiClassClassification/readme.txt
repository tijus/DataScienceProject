Part 1: 



Part 2:

There are two main parts of code:

1) extractArticles.ipyb
- notebook for extraction of different categories of articles

2) multiClassClassification.ipynb
- this runs the classification on the extracted data set using various feature extraction strategies and classification algorithms 
For execution
- run all the 3 blocks of code in the notebook in a sequential fashion one after the other
- in main give appropriate input as directed  for choosing feature extraction strategy and algorithm selection
